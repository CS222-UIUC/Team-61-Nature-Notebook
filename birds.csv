ID, Name, Description
001.Black_footed_Albatross,Black footed Albatross,"The black-footed albatross (Phoebastria nigripes) is a large seabird of the albatross family Diomedeidae from the North Pacific. All but 2.5% of the population is found among the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. It is one of three species of albatross that range in the northern hemisphere, nesting on isolated tropical islands. Unlike many albatrosses, it is dark plumaged. Black-footed albatrosses are a type of albatross that belong to family Diomedeidae of the order Procellariiformes, along with shearwaters, fulmars, storm petrels, and diving petrels. They share certain identifying features. First, they have nasal passages that attach to the upper bill called naricorns. Although the nostrils on the albatross are on the sides of the bill. The bills of Procellariiformes are also unique in that they are split into between seven and nine horny plates. Finally, they produce a stomach oil made up of wax esters and triglycerides that is stored in the proventriculus. This is used both against predators and as an energy rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights.[4] They also have a salt gland that is situated above the nasal passage that helps desalinate their bodies, to compensate for the high amount of ocean water that they imbibe. It excretes a high saline solution from their nose.[5] The specific epithet of nigripes is derived from two Latin words, niger meaning ""black"", and pes meaning ""foot"".[6]"
002.Laysan_Albatross,Laysan Albatross,"The Laysan albatross (Phoebastria immutabilis) is a large seabird that ranges across the North Pacific. The Northwestern Hawaiian Islands are home to 99.7% of the population. This small (for its family) gull-like albatross is the second-most common seabird in the Hawaiian Islands, with an estimated population of 1.18 million birds, and is currently expanding (or possibly re-expanding) its range to new islands. The Laysan albatross was first described as Diomedea immutabilis by Lionel Walter Rothschild, in 1893, on the basis of a specimen from Laysan Island.[3] It is named for Laysan, one of its breeding colonies in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands."
003.Sooty_Albatross,Sooty Albatross," The sooty albatross (Phoebetria fusca), also known to sailors as the Quaker, is a species of marine bird belonging to the albatross family Diomedeidae. It is a medium-sized albatross that sports a sooty-brown or sooty-black color. It can be found in the southern Atlantic Ocean, the southern Indian Ocean, and the Southern Ocean. This bird scavenges for squid, fish, and carrion. Like other albatrosses, these birds mate for life and return to the same breeding spots every season. A single pair will mate every other year on a variety of islands in the southern Atlantic Ocean and the southern Indian Ocean islands. This bird is an endangered species and conservation efforts are taking place. The sooty albatross belongs to the genus Phoebetria of which there are two species: P. palpebrata (Foster, 1785) and P. fusca (Hilsenberg, 1822).[3] The two species were discovered separately but were not placed in the same genus until 1913, which was later confirmed by cytochrome-b gene sequencing.[4] Sooty albatrosses belong to the Diomedeidae family, which comprises albatrosses and mollymawks. Of the Diomedeidae, the sooty albatross belongs to the genus Phoebetria, one of the four genera in the family.[5] Diomedeidae is a part of the order Procellariiformes which are tube-nosed seabirds including shearwaters, fulmars, petrels, and of course albatrosses.[6]"
004.Groove_billed_Ani,Groove billed Ani," The groove-billed ani (Crotophaga sulcirostris) is a tropical bird in the cuckoo family with a long tail and a large, curved beak. It is a resident species throughout most of its range, from southern Texas, central Mexico and The Bahamas, through Central America, to northern Colombia and Venezuela, and coastal Ecuador and Peru. It only retreats from the northern limits of its range in Texas and northern Mexico during winter. The groove-billed ani was formally described by the English naturalist William Swainson from a specimen collected in Temascaltepec, Mexico. It still bears its original binomial name of Crotophaga sulcirostris.[2][3] The specific epithet combines the Latin sulcus meaning ""furrow"" with -rostris meaning ""-billed"".[4] The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.[3]"
005.Crested_Auklet,Crested Auklet,"The crested auklet (Aethia cristatella) is a small seabird of the family Alcidae, distributed throughout the northern Pacific and the Bering Sea. The species feeds by diving in deep waters, eating krill and a variety of small marine animals. It nests in dense colonies of up to 1 million individuals in the Bering Sea and the Sea of Okhotsk. It often breeds in mixed-species colonies with the least auklet, a smaller congener. The species is known for its sexual ornaments, found in both males and females. These include colorful plumage with a forehead crest, a striking scent recalling citrus fruit, and a loud trumpet call, all of which appear to have evolved through sexual selection. The total population is around 6 million, almost half in North America. It is in general considered to be of least concern, though the Alaskan population faces additional threats from predation and oil spills."
006.Least_Auklet,Least Auklet,"The least auklet (Aethia pusilla) is a seabird and the smallest species of auk. It is the most abundant seabird in North America, and one of the most abundant in the world, with a population of around nine million birds. They breed on the islands of Alaska and Siberia, and spend the winter close to the edge of the ice sheet[clarification needed].  Their largest colonies are on the Aleutian Islands, St. Lawrence Island and Little Diomede Island. Least auklets feed predominantly on calanoid copepods, particularly those of the genus Neocalanus. They also eat euphausiids, pteropods and other zooplankton species. They hunt for these in stratified waters caused where upwelling and thermoclines cause these prey items to be tightly clumped together. Like all auks they are pursuit divers, using their wings to provide thrust and ""fly"" under the water. They are voracious predators, consuming 86% of their body weight each day. Least auklets are highly colonial, nesting in rocky crevices in colonies of up to a million birds. These colonies are often mixed, with other species of auklet nesting with, and competing with the least auklets. While this coexistence with other species may bring the benefits of protection from predators, least auklets are vulnerable to being displaced from their nesting sites by the larger crested auklets. A single egg is laid in the crevice and incubated for a month, after which a semi-precocial black downy chick is hatched. Both parents share incubation duties, as well as brooding and feeding duties. Unlike many auks, which are fed fish carried crosswise in the bill, chicks of the least auklet are fed copepods and other zooplankton from a sublingual pouch, as are other small auklets. The chicks receive no further parental care after they fledge, and can dive to hunt as soon as they leave the nest. Least auklets are vulnerable to oil spills and introduced species. The introduction of Arctic foxes to many of the Aleutian Islands caused the species to be wiped out on many of those islands, and rats are also a problem on many islands. However, at present they are still a very common species, and are not considered threatened by the IUCN."
007.Parakeet_Auklet,Parakeet Auklet,"The parakeet auklet (Aethia psittacula) is a small seabird of the North Pacific. Parakeet Auklets used to be placed on its own in the genus Cyclorrhynchus (Kaup, 1829) but recent morphological and genetic evidence suggest it should be placed in the genus Aethia, making them closely related to crested auklets and least auklets. It is associated with the boreal waters of Alaska, Kamchatka and Siberia. It breeds on the cliffs, slopes and boulder fields of offshore islands, generally moving south during the winter."
008.Rhinoceros_Auklet,Rhinoceros Auklet," The rhinoceros auklet (Cerorhinca monocerata) is a seabird and a close relative of the puffins. It is the only extant species of the genus Cerorhinca. Given its close relationship with the puffins, the common name rhinoceros puffin has been proposed for the species.[2] It ranges widely across the North Pacific, feeding on small fish and nesting in colonies. Its name is derived from a horn-like extension of the beak (the anatomic term for this extension is the rhamphotheca). This horn is only present in breeding adults, and like the elaborate sheath on the bill of puffins is shed every year. This horn also possesses fluorescent properties, which is likely involved in reproductive signalling.[3] The rhinoceros auklet (also known as the rhino auklet, horn-billed puffin, or unicorn puffin), is a medium-sized auk with a large, strong, orange/brown bill (with the 'horn' protruding from it). The plumage is dark on top and paler below; breeding adults (both male and female) possess white plumes above the eyes and behind the bill. Males are slightly larger than females (about 10% in mass).[citation needed] The rhinoceros auklet is a North Pacific auk that breeds from California (the Channel Islands) to the Aleutian Islands in Alaska in North America; and Hokkaidō and Honshū, Japan, as well as the Korean Peninsula and Sakhalin Island in Asia. It winters both in offshore and inshore waters, exhibiting some migration. Between October and April, migration of a large number occurs on pelagic California waters, most coming from breeding colonies north of California. Auks that reside off the California coast remain in their areas.[4] Breeding occurs in the early summer months, ranging from May to June. The auklet nests in burrows dug into the soil, or in natural caves and cavities between 1 and 5 m deep. It prefers nesting sites on slight inclines to aid take-off, as it is a poor flier. A single egg is incubated by both parents for 30–35 days. The semiprecocial chick is then fed each night with a bill full of fish (in the manner of puffins) for 35–45 days. This nocturnal behaviour is believed to be a response to predation and kleptoparasitism by gulls.[4][5] Rhinoceros auklets are monogamous, and although they migrate across similar areas during the non-breeding season, pair-mates migrate separately. However, they do synchronize their foraging activity once they return to the colony during the pre-laying period.[6] At sea, rhinoceros auklets feed on fish, with some krill and squid taken also. They feed inshore during the breeding season in the midwater.  To catch their prey, they dive as deep as 57 meters (187 ft) for as long as 148 seconds.[7] Diet studies of nesting rhinoceros auklets show that their diet is variable depending on the location of the bird's nest. At one island located near the Salish Sea off of the Washington coast, auklets feed mainly on sand lance, while at a separate island also off of the Washington coast, auklets feed on anchovy and smelt.[8] The genus Cerorhinca evolved in the North Pacific, apparently in the mid-late Miocene. Although today only one species remains, it used to be much more diverse, both in number of species and in distribution. Fossils have been found as far south as Baja California. The first record of the clade from the Atlantic Ocean was reported by Smith et al. (2007) and suggests that the biogeographic history of Cerorhinca is more complex than previously thought.[9] Known prehistoric species are: Since rhinoceros auklets are monogamous and highly social, the species depend heavily on physical characteristics of the other species in order to choose a lifetime mate.[10] The prominent horn on the bill of breeding rhinoceros auklet is one evolutionary byproduct of this behavior. The bill has fluorescent characteristics when viewed under ultraviolet light. Several bird species are able to detect cues through UV light,[11] which supports the claim that this fluorescence is also meant for breeding purposes. While the upper and lower mandible give off fluorescence as well, this phenomenon is most prominent in the horn. There is no evidence for disparity of fluorescence between sexes, however, the amount of fluorescence does vary between individual auks.[3]"
009.Brewer_Blackbird,Brewer's Blackbird,Brewer's blackbird (Euphagus cyanocephalus) is a medium-sized New World blackbird. It is named after the ornithologist Thomas Mayo Brewer.
010.Red_winged_Blackbird,Red winged Blackbird,"The red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus) is a passerine bird of the family Icteridae found in most of North America and much of Central America. It breeds from Alaska and Newfoundland south to Florida, the Gulf of Mexico, Mexico, and Guatemala, with isolated populations in western El Salvador, northwestern Honduras, and northwestern Costa Rica. It may winter as far north as Pennsylvania and British Columbia, but northern populations are generally migratory, moving south to Mexico and the Southern United States. Claims have been made that it is the most abundant living land bird in North America, as bird-counting censuses of wintering red-winged blackbirds sometimes show that loose flocks can number in excess of a million birds per flock and the full number of breeding pairs across North and Central America may exceed 250 million in peak years. It also ranks among the best-studied wild bird species in the world.[2][3][4][5][6] The red-winged blackbird is sexually dimorphic; the male is all black with a red shoulder and yellow wing bar, while the female is a nondescript dark brown. Seeds and insects make up the bulk of the red-winged blackbird's diet. The red-winged blackbird is one of five species in the genus Agelaius and is included in the family Icteridae, which is made up of passerine birds found in North and South America.[7] The red-winged blackbird was formally described as Oriolus phoeniceus by Carl Linnaeus in 1766 in the twelfth edition of his Systema Naturae,[8] but was later moved with the other American blackbirds to the genus Agelaius by Louis Pierre Vieillot in 1816.[9] Linnaeus specified the type location as ""America"" but this was restricted to Charleston, South Carolina in 1928.[10][11] The genus name is derived from Ancient Greek agelaios, meaning ""gregarious"". The specific epithet, phoeniceus, is Latin meaning ""crimson"" or ""red"".[12] The red-winged blackbird is a sister species to the red-shouldered blackbird (Agelaius assimilis) that is endemic to Cuba. These two species are together sister to the tricolored blackbird (Agelaius tricolor) that is found on the Pacific coast region of the California and upper Baja California in Mexico.[13][14] Depending on the authority, between 20 and 24 subspecies are recognised which are mostly quite similar in appearance.[15][16] However, there are two isolated populations of bicolored blackbirds that are quite distinctive: A. p. californicus of California and A. p. gubernator of central Mexico. The taxonomy and relationships between these two populations and with red-winged blackbirds is still unclear.[17] Despite the similarities in most forms of the red-winged blackbird, in the subspecies of Mexican Plateau, A. p. gubernator, the female's veining is greatly reduced and restricted to the throat; the rest of the plumage is very dark brown,[18][self-published source?][19] and also in a different family from the European redwing and the Old World common blackbird, which are thrushes (Turdidae).[20] In the California subspecies, A. p. californicus and A. p. mailliardorum, the veining of the female specimens also covers a smaller surface and the plumage is dark brown, although not in the gubernator grade;[19] and also its superciliary list is absent or poorly developed.[18] The male subspecies mailliardorum, californicus, aciculatus, neutralis, and gubernator lack the yellow band on the wing that is present in most male members of the other subspecies.[18][16] The red-shouldered blackbird was formerly considered as a subspecies of red-winged blackbird. They were split by the American Ornithologists' Union in 1997.[21] Listed below are the red-winged blackbird subspecies and groups of subspecies recognized as of January 2014 with their respective distribution areas and the location of their wintering quarters:[16]"
011.Rusty_Blackbird,Rusty Blackbird," The rusty blackbird (Euphagus carolinus) is a medium-sized New World blackbird, closely related to grackles (""rusty grackle"" is an older name for the species). It is a bird that prefers wet forested areas, breeding in the boreal forest and muskeg across northern Canada, and migrating southeast to the United States during winter. Formerly abundant, the rusty blackbird has undergone one of the most rapid declines of any abundant bird species in North America in recent years, for reasons that are not well understood."
012.Yellow_headed_Blackbird,Yellow headed Blackbird," The yellow-headed blackbird (Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus) is a medium-sized blackbird with a yellow head. It is the only member of the genus Xanthocephalus. Their scientific name derives from the Greek word for yellow, xanthous, and the word for head, cephalus.[2]"
013.Bobolink,Bobolink," The bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) is a small New World blackbird and the only member of the genus Dolichonyx. An old name for this species is the ""rice bird"", from its tendency to feed on cultivated grains during winter and migration. The bobolink breeds in the summer in the United States and Canada, with most of the summer range in the northern U.S. Bobolinks winter in southern South America, primarily Paraguay, Argentina, and Bolivia. Bobolink populations are rapidly declining due to numerous factors, such as agricultural intensification and habitat loss; they are considered threatened in Canada, and are at risk throughout their range. The bobolink was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae. He placed it with the finches in the genus Fringilla and coined the binomial name Fringilla oryzivora.[2] Linnaeus mainly based his account on ""The Rice-Bird"" that had been described and illustrated in 1729 by the English naturalist Mark Catesby in his book The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands.[3] Linnaeus specified the type locality as ""Cuba ... in Carolinam"" but this was restricted to the state of South Carolina by the American Ornithologists' Union in 1931.[4][5] The bobolink is now the only species placed in the genus Dolichonyx that was introduced in 1827 by the English zoologist William Swainson.[6][7] The genus name combines the Ancient Greek δολιχος/dolikhos meaning ""long"" with ονυξ/onux, ονυχος/onukhos meaning ""claw"" or ""nail"".[8] The specific epithet oryzivorus combines the Latin oryza meaning ""rice"" with -vorus meaning ""eating"".[9] The English name ""bobolink"" is from Bob o' Lincoln, describing the call.[10] The species is considered to be monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.[7]"
014.Indigo_Bunting,Indigo Bunting,"The indigo bunting (Passerina cyanea) is a small seed-eating bird in the cardinal family, Cardinalidae. It is migratory, ranging from southern Canada to northern Florida during the breeding season, and from southern Florida to northern South America during the winter. It often migrates by night, using the stars to navigate. Its habitat is farmland, brush areas, and open woodland. The indigo bunting is closely related to the lazuli bunting and interbreeds with the species where their ranges overlap. The indigo bunting is a small bird, measuring 11.5–13 cm (4.5–5.1 in) in length. It displays sexual dimorphism in its coloration; the male is vibrant blue in the summer, with brightly colored plumage during the breeding season to attract a mate. It is brown during the winter months, while the female is brown year-round. Nest-building and incubation are done solely by the female. The diet of the indigo bunting consists primarily of insects during the summer months and seeds during the winter months."
015.Lazuli_Bunting,Lazuli Bunting,The lazuli bunting (Passerina amoena) is a North American songbird named for the gemstone lapis lazuli.
016.Painted_Bunting,Painted Bunting,"The painted bunting (Passerina ciris) is a species of bird in the cardinal family, Cardinalidae. It is native to North America. The bright plumage of the male comes only in the second year of life; in the first year, they can be distinguished from the female only by close inspection. The painted bunting was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae under the binomial name Emberiza ciris.[2] Linnaeus based his account mainly on the ""Painted Finch"" that had been described and illustrated in 1730 by the English naturalist Mark Catesby in his book The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands.[3]  Linnaeus specified the type locality as America but this was restricted to the state of South Carolina by the American Ornithologists' Union in 1931.[4][5] The specific epithet ciris is the Latin name for a  mythical bird, from Ancient Greek κειρις/keiris for an unidentified bird.[6] The painted bunting is now one of seven species placed in the genus Passerina that was introduced in 1816 by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot.[7] Two subspecies are recognised:[7] The painted bunting is also called the Mexican canary, painted finch, pope, or nonpareil.[8]"
017.Cardinal,Cardinal,Cardinal or The Cardinal most commonly refers to Cardinal or The Cardinal may also refer to: In addition to the aforementioned cardinalids:
018.Spotted_Catbird,Spotted Catbird," The spotted catbird (Ailuroedus maculosus) is a species of bowerbird (Ptilonorhynchidae) which can be found in north Queensland, the eastern Moluccas and New Guinea.[1] Although it is a member of the bowerbird family it does not build a bower. Widespread and common throughout its large range, the spotted catbird is evaluated as Least Concern on IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.
It is a chunky rainforest bird with emerald green upperparts, a black spot below the dark red eye, and green-olive underparts with extensive pale spotting.
It inhabits the Wet Tropics of northern Queensland (Cairns region), and thus does not overlap with similar green catbird. The spotted catbird is one of ten species in the genus Ailuroedus, the non bower-building bowerbirds. The noticeable difference between the two Australian dwelling species is the lack of black ear-coverts and reduction in dorsal spotting on A. cassirostris.[2] Molecular evidence suggests Ailuroedus is a sister group to the other bowerbirds, diverging into the only genus within the eight species of Australian bowerbirds that is monogamous and does not build a bower or clear a court for mating.[3][4] The other bowerbirds are polygynous and make various forms of bowers or create stages for mating.[5] One study revealed the catbirds have a smaller brain for their body size compared to the bower-building species.[6] Until 2016, A. maculosus was considered a subspecies of either A. melanotis, then also named the spotted catbird, or as a subspecies of A. crassirostris (green catbird). The spotted catbird is an Australo-Papuan species. It can be found in tropical rainforest and is locally common in its range.[7] Within Australia it has two isolated populations, both located in far north Queensland. One group occurs on Cape York and the other further south in the wet tropics region.[1][2] The tropical forests of the Bellenden Ker range and adjoining scrub area from Cardwell to Cooktown may be the species ""headquarters"".[8] Spotted catbirds are a highly specialized rainforest species and in the Australian wet tropics they prefer to nest in well vegetated areas with steep creek slopes and also in forests with Calamus tangles and will nest in the same location year after year.[9][10] They have a home range of 1-2 hectares and forage about 68 m from their nests.[9] Destruction of their rainforest habitat and rising temperatures could pose a threat to the spotted catbird.[11] There have been attempts at revegetation on the Atherton Tablelands in north Queensland. This has resulted in habitat heterogeneity. These attempts may not be helpful to the habitat specific species.[12] This rainforest fragmentation creates corridors in the attempt to provide habitat for rainforest birds. These corridors are subject to edge effects and go unused by the specialized rainforest species.[13] However, they have been regularly detected in well-established rainforest regrowth in Australia.[14]"
019.Gray_Catbird,Gray Catbird,"The gray catbird (Dumetella carolinensis), also spelled grey catbird, is a medium-sized North American and Central American perching bird of the mimid family. It is the only member of the ""catbird"" genus Dumetella. Like the black catbird (Melanoptila glabrirostris), it is among the basal lineages of the Mimidae, probably a closer relative of the Caribbean thrasher and trembler assemblage than of the mockingbirds and Toxostoma thrashers.[2][3] In some areas it is known as the slate-colored mockingbird.[4] The name Dumetella is based upon the Latin term dūmus (""thorny thicket"");[5] it thus means approximately ""small thornbush-dweller"" or ""small bird of the thornbushes"". It refers to the species' habit of singing when hidden in undergrowth. The specific name carolinensis is Neo-Latin for ""from the Carolinas"".[6] The species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1766 edition of Systema naturae. His original name Muscicapa carolinensis reflected the belief, widespread at that time, that the gray catbird was some sort of Old World flycatcher (presumably due to its remarkably plain coloration, not similar to other mimids).[7] The genus name has a convoluted nomenclatorial history. The monotypic genus Galeoscoptes, proposed by Jean Cabanis in 1850, was widely used up to 1907. This name roughly means ""capped mockingbird"", from Latin galea ""helmet"" and Ancient Greek skóptein (σκώπτειν, ""to scold"" or ""to mock""). But as it turned out, Dumetella was a technically acceptable senior synonym, even though the peculiar circumstances of its publishing left the identity of its author unsolved until 1989. As it turned out, the genus name was published by C.T. Wood in 1837. His description is somewhat eccentric, and was published under his pseudonym ""S.D.W."". Wood misquotes his source—John Latham's 1783 General Synopsis of Birds—as calling the bird ""cat thrush"", probably because he knew the species under that name from George Shaw's General Zoology. Latham's name was ""cat flycatcher"", analogous to the scientific name of Linné.[5][7][8] Shaw (and subsequently C.T. Wood) used Louis Pierre Vieillot's specific name felivox. This means ""cat voice"", a contraction of Latin felis (""cat"") and vox (""voice""). Vieillot, differing from the earlier authors, believed the bird to be a true thrush (Turdus).[5][9] Though mimids were widely considered Turdidae until the 1850s, this was not any more correct than treating them as Old World flycatchers, as these three families are distinct lineages of the superfamily Muscicapoidea. In the mid-20th century, the Turdidae and even most of the Sylvioidea were lumped in the Muscicapidae—but the Mimidae were not. Lastly, the smaller gray catbirds from Bermuda, which have proportionally narrow and shorter rectrices and primary remiges, were described as subspecies bermudianus (""from Bermuda"") by Outram Bangs in 1901. But this taxon was never widely accepted, and today the gray catbird is generally considered monotypic as a species, too."
020.Yellow_breasted_Chat,Yellow breasted Chat,"The yellow-breasted chat (Icteria virens) is a large songbird found in America, and is the only member of the family Icteriidae. It was once a member of the New World warbler family Parulidae, but in 2017, the American Ornithological Society moved it to its own family. Its placement is not definitively resolved. The yellow-breasted chat was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae. He placed it with the thrushes in the genus Turdus, coined the binomial name Turdus virens, and specified the type locality as ""America"".[2] The specific epithet is Latin meaning ""green"".[3] The locality has been restricted to South Carolina.[4] Linnaeus based his account on the ""yellow brested chat"" that had been described and illustrated by the English naturalist Mark Catesby in his book The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands.[5] It is now the only species placed in the genus Icteria that was introduced in 1808 by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot.[6][7] It is also the only species placed in the family Icteriidae that was introduced (as Icterieae) in 1858 by the American naturalist Spencer Baird.[7][8][9] The yellow-breasted chat was formerly considered the largest member of the family Parulidae, but following taxonomic studies, it was moved to the monotypic family Icteriidae in 2017.[10] Although Icteriidae is a distinct family from the New World blackbirds (Icteridae), which have a very similar name, taxonomic studies support them as being the closest living relatives of one another, and in a 2019 study[11] Carl Oliveros and colleagues actually classified the yellow-breasted chat as a member of Icteridae. In addition, the former grouping of the yellow-breasted chat as a warbler was not too far off because phylogenomic studies have placed Parulidae as sister to a clade that includes Icteridae. Those results make it reasonable to view Parulidae the sister group to the clade comprising Icteridae and Icteriidae, as in Oliveros et al.[11] The cladogram below shows the relationship of the yellow-breasted chat to the other families. It is based on the molecular phylogenetic study by Carl Oliveros and collaborators that was published in 2019.[11] The species numbers are taken from the list maintained by Frank Gill, Pamela Rasmussen and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithological Committee (IOC).[7] Parulidae – New World warblers (120 species) Icteriidae – yellow-breasted chat Icteridae – New World blackbirds (108 species)"
021.Eastern_Towhee,Eastern Towhee,"The eastern towhee (Pipilo erythrophthalmus), also known as chewink, joree, or joree bird,[2] is a large New World sparrow. The taxonomy of the towhees has been under debate in recent decades, and formerly this bird and the spotted towhee were considered a single species, the rufous-sided towhee. Their breeding habitat is brushy areas across eastern North America. They nest either low in bushes or on the ground under shrubs. Northern birds migrate to the southern United States. There has been one record of this species as a vagrant to western Europe: a single bird in Great Britain in 1966.[3] The song is a short drink your teeeeea lasting around one second, starting with a sharp call (""drink!"") and ending with a short trill ""teeeeea"". The name ""towhee"" is onomatopoeic description of one of the towhee's most common calls, a short two-part call rising in pitch and sometimes also called a ""chewink"" call.[4] The eastern towhee was described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae and given the binomial name Fringilla erythrophthalma.[5] This species is now placed in the genus Pipilo that was introduced by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot in 1816.[6] The specific name erythrophthalmus/erythrophthalma combines the Ancient Greek words ερυθρος eruthros ""red"" and οφθαλμος ophthalmos ""eye"".[7] Four subspecies are recognised:[8]"
022.Chuck_will_Widow,Chuck will's widow,"The chuck-will's-widow (Antrostomus carolinensis) is a nocturnal bird of the nightjar family Caprimulgidae. It is mostly found in the southeastern United States (with disjunct populations in Long Island, New York; Ontario, Canada; and Cape Cod, Massachusetts) near swamps, rocky uplands, and pine woods. It migrates to the West Indies, Central America, and northwestern South America. The chuck-will's-widow was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus's Systema Naturae. He placed it with all the other nightjars in the genus Caprimulgus and coined the binomial name Caprimulgus carolinensis.[3] Gmelin based his description on those of earlier authors including the ""Goat-sucker of Carolina"" that had been described and illustrated by the English naturalist Mark Catesby in his The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands  that was published between 1729 and 1732.[4] Chuck-will's-widow is now placed with 11 other species in the genus Antrostomus that was erected by the French naturalist Charles Bonaparte in 1838.[5][6] The generic name combines the Ancient Greek antron meaning ""cavern"" and stoma meaning ""mouth"". The specific epithet carolinensis is from the toponym Carolina.[7] The type locality is South Carolina.[8] The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.[6] The common English name ""chuck-will's-widow "" is an onomatopoeia from the bird's song.[9] Alternative names include ""chuckwuts-widow"" and ""chip-fell-out-of-a-oak"".[10] This bird is sometimes confused with the better-known whippoorwill (Antrostomus vociferus),[11] because of their similar calls and unusual names. Though rather closely related, they are two distinct species."
023.Brandt_Cormorant,Brandt's Cormorant,"Brandt's cormorant (Urile penicillatus) is a strictly marine bird of the cormorant family of seabirds that inhabits the Pacific coast of North America. It ranges, in the summer, from Alaska to the Gulf of California, but the population north of Vancouver Island migrates south during the winter. Its specific name, penicillatus is Latin for a painter's brush (pencil of hairs), in reference to white plumes on its neck and back during the early breeding season. The common name honors the German naturalist Johann Friedrich von Brandt of the Academy of Sciences at St. Petersburg, who described the species from specimens collected on expeditions to the Pacific during the early 19th century. It was formerly classified in the genus Phalacrocorax, but a 2014 study supported reclassifying it and several other Pacific cormorant species into the genus Urile.[2] The IOU followed this classification in 2021.[3]"
024.Red_faced_Cormorant,Red faced Cormorant,"The red-faced cormorant (Urile urile), red-faced shag or violet shag, is a bird species of the family Phalacrocoracidae. Its range spans from the eastern tip of Hokkaidō in Japan, northern korean peninsula, via the Kuril Islands, the southern tip of the Kamchatka Peninsula and the Aleutian Arc to the Alaska Peninsula and Gulf of Alaska. The red-faced cormorant was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus's Systema Naturae. He placed it in the genus Pelecanus and coined the binomial name Pelecanus urile.[2] Gmelin based his description on the ""red faced shag"" of John Latham and the ""red faced corvarant"" of Thomas Pennant.[3][4] The authors cited different translations of an account of Georg Wilhelm Steller's exploration of the Kamchatka Peninsula.[5][6] The red-faced cormorant was formerly classified in the genus Phalacrocorax; it was moved to the resurrected genus Urile based on a molecular phylogenetic study published in 2014.[7][8] The genus had been introduced in 1856 by the French naturalist Charles Lucien Bonaparte.[9] The epithet urile is possibly derived from the Russian vernacular name of this species, referring to the Kuril Islands where this species is now very rare.[10][11] The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.[8] Within the genus Urile the red-faced cormorant is closely related to the pelagic cormorant (Urile pelagicus).[7]"
025.Pelagic_Cormorant,Pelagic Cormorant,"The pelagic cormorant (Urile pelagicus), also known as Baird's cormorant or violet-green cormorant, is a small member of the cormorant family Phalacrocoracidae. Analogous to other smallish cormorants, it is also called the pelagic shag occasionally. This seabird lives along the coasts of the northern Pacific; during winter it can also be found in the open ocean.[2] Pelagic cormorants have relatively short wings due to their need for economical movement underwater, and consequently have the highest flight costs of any bird.[3] It was formerly classified in the genus Phalacrocorax, but a 2014 study supported reclassifying it and several other Pacific cormorant species into the genus Urile.[4] The IOC followed this classification in 2021.[5]"
026.Bronzed_Cowbird,Bronzed Cowbird," The bronzed cowbird (Molothrus aeneus), once known as the red-eyed cowbird, is a small icterid. They breed from the U.S. states of California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and Louisiana south through Central America to Panama. They tend to be found in farmland, brush, and feedlots. Outside the breeding season, they are found in very open habitats, and roost in thick woods. These birds forage in open areas, often near cattle in pastures. Their diet mostly consists of seeds and insects, along with snails during breeding season for a calcium source.[2]
There are three subspecies:[3] The bronze-brown cowbird, which is restricted to the Caribbean coast of Colombia, was formerly considered to be an isolated population of this species.[3] The male bronzed cowbird is 20 cm (7.9 in) long and weighs 68 g (2.4 oz), with green-bronze, gloss-black plumage. His eyes are red in breeding season and brown otherwise. The female is 18.5 cm (7.3 in) long and weighs 56 g (2.0 oz). She is a dull black with a brown underbelly, and has brown eyes. Young birds have coloring similar to the females, with the exception of grey feather fringes.[4] Like all cowbirds, this bird is an obligate brood parasite; it lays its eggs in the nests of other birds. The young cowbird is fed by the host parents at the expense of their own young. Hosts include Prevost's ground-sparrows and white-naped brush finches. They develop rapidly, leaving the nest after 10–12 days. "
027.Shiny_Cowbird,Shiny Cowbird," The shiny cowbird (Molothrus bonariensis) is a passerine bird in the New World family Icteridae. It breeds in most of South America except for dense forests and areas of high altitude such as mountains.[2] Since 1900 the shiny cowbird's range has shifted northward, and it was recorded in the Caribbean islands as well as the United States, where it is found breeding in southern Florida.[3] It is a bird associated with open habitats, including disturbed land from agriculture and deforestation.[2] Adults are sexually dimorphic. Males are all black with a purple-blue iridescence. The female is smaller, with dull brown plumage that is sometimes paler on the underparts. Females of the species can be distinguished from the female brown-headed cowbird by their longer, finer bills and flatter heads.[2] The shiny cowbird's diet consists mainly of insects, other arthropods[4] and seeds, and they have been recorded foraging for grains in cattle troughs.[2] Like most other cowbirds, it is an obligate brood parasite, laying its eggs in the nests of many other bird species such as the rufous-collared sparrow.[5] Different host species show different responses to their nests being parasitised, with behaviours ranging from accepting and caring for the cowbird eggs, to rejecting the eggs from the nest.[2] As the shiny cowbird is an effective generalist brood parasite, it can be considered the South American counterpart to the brown-headed cowbird.[6] The shiny cowbird was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus's Systema Naturae. He placed it with the tanagers in the genus Tangara and coined the binomial name Tanagra bonariensis.[7] The specific epithet is Modern Latin for Buenos Aires, the type location.[8] Gmelin based his description on ""le tangavio"" from Buenos Aires that had been described in 1778 by the French polymath the Comte de Buffon.[9] A hand-coloured engraving by François-Nicolas Martinet was published separately to accompany Buffon's text.[10] The shiny cowbird is now one of six cowbirds placed in the genus Molothrus that was introduced in 1832 by William Swainson.[11] Seven subspecies are recognised:[11]"
028.Brown_Creeper,Brown Creeper," The brown creeper (Certhia americana), also known as the American treecreeper, is a small songbird, the only North American member of the treecreeper family Certhiidae."
029.American_Crow,American Crow," The American crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos) is a large passerine bird species of the family Corvidae. It is a common bird found throughout much of North America. American crows are the New World counterpart to the carrion crow and the hooded crow of Eurasia; they all occupy the same ecological niche. Although the American crow and the hooded crow are very similar in size, structure and behavior, their calls and visual appearance are different. From beak to tail, an American crow measures 40–50 cm (16–20 in), almost half of which is tail. Its wingspan is 85–100 cm (33–39 in). Mass varies from about 300 to 600 g (11 to 21 oz), with males tending to be larger than females. Plumage is all black, with iridescent feathers. It looks much like other all-black corvids.  They are very intelligent, and adaptable to human environments. The most usual call is CaaW!-CaaW!-CaaW! They can be distinguished from the common raven (C. corax) because American crows are smaller and the beak is slightly less pronounced; from the fish crow (C. ossifragus) because American crows do not hunch and fluff their throat feathers when they call; and from the carrion crow (C. corone) by size, as the carrion crow is larger and of a stockier build. American crows are common, widespread, and susceptible to the West Nile virus, making them useful as a bioindicator to track the virus's spread. Direct transmission of the virus from crows to humans is impossible. The American crow was described by German ornithologist Christian Ludwig Brehm in 1822.[3] Its scientific name means literally 'short-billed crow', from Ancient Greek βραχυ- brachy- ('short-') and ρυνχος rhynchos ('billed').[4] A 2012 genetic analysis of the genus Corvus by Knud A Jønsson and colleagues using nuclear and mitochondrial DNA calculated that the American crow diverged from a lineage that gave rise to the collared, carrion and hooded crows around 5 million years ago.[5] ""American crow"" has been designated the official name by the International Ornithologists' Union (IOC).[6] The number of subspecies varies by authority, ranging between three and five. The unclear taxonomy of the northwestern crow, previously its own species, has complicated subspecies determinations. Subspecies differ in bill proportion and form a rough NE–SW clinal in size across North America. Birds are smallest in the far west and on the southern coast.[7][3]"
030.Fish_Crow,Fish Crow," The fish crow (Corvus ossifragus) is a species of crow associated with wetland habitats in the eastern and southeastern United States. The fish crow was given its binomial name by the Scottish ornithologist Alexander Wilson in 1812, in the fifth volume of his American Ornithology.[3][4] The binomial is from Latin; Corvus means ""raven"", while ossifragus means ""bone-breaker"". It is derived from os or ossis, meaning ""bone"", and frangere, meaning ""to break"".[5] The English-language common name fish crow also derives from Wilson, who ascribed the name to the crow's aquatic diet, as described to him by local fishermen. He distinguished the fish crow from John Bartram's great seaside crow by the former's diminutive size when compared to the American crow.[3] The fish crow's taxonomic relation to other species of the Corvus genus is still poorly understood, but DNA sequencing indicates that it is most closely related to the palm crow (C. palmarum) and the Jamaican crow (C. jamaicensis), with the three species forming a Nearctic clade.[6] The Sinaloa crow (C. sinaloae) and Tamaulipas crow (C. imparatus) bear morphological similarities to and were once considered conspecific subspecies of the fish crow,[7] but have since been recognized as distinct species.[8]"
031.Black_billed_Cuckoo,Black billed Cuckoo," The black-billed cuckoo (Coccyzus erythropthalmus) is a New World species in the Cuculidae (cuckoo) family. The scientific name is from Ancient Greek. The genus name, kokkuzo, means to call like a common cuckoo, and erythropthalmus is from eruthros, ""red"" and ophthalmos, ""eye"".[2] It is very similar and overlaps in range with the closely related yellow-billed cuckoo. A distinguishing characteristic of the family Cuculidae is laying eggs in the nests of other birds. Although many cuckoos are obligate brood parasites, C. erythropthalmus often incubate their own chicks.[3]"
032.Mangrove_Cuckoo,Mangrove Cuckoo," The mangrove cuckoo (Coccyzus minor) is a species of cuckoo that is native to the Neotropics. The mangrove cuckoo was formally described in 1788 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus's Systema Naturae. He placed it with all the other cuckoos in the genus Cuculus and coined the binomial name Cuculus minor.[2] Gmelin based his description on ""Le petit vieillard"" or ""Coucou des palétuviers"" from Cayenne that had been described and illustrated in 1779 by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon.[3][4] The mangrove cuckoo is now placed with 12 other species in the genus Coccyzus that was introduced in 1816 by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot.[5][6] The genus name is from the Ancient Greek kokkuzō meaning ""to cry cuckoo"".[7] The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.[6]"
033.Yellow_billed_Cuckoo,Yellow billed Cuckoo,"The yellow-billed cuckoo (Coccyzus americanus) is a member of the cuckoo family. Common folk names for this bird in the southern United States are rain crow and storm crow. These likely refer to the bird's habit of calling on hot days, often presaging rain or thunderstorms. The genus name is from the Ancient Greek kokkuzo, which means to call like a common cuckoo, and americanus means ""of America"". The yellow-billed cuckoo was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae. He placed it with all the other cuckoos in the genus Cuculus and coined the binomial name Cuculus americanus.[2] Linnaeus based his description on the ""Cuckow of Carolina"" that had been described and illustrated in 1729–1732 by the English naturalist Mark Catesby in his The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands.[3] The yellow-billed cuckoo is now placed with 12 other species in the genus Coccyzus that was introduced in 1816 by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot.[4][5] The genus name is from the Ancient Greek kokkuzō meaning ""to cry cuckoo"".[6] The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.[5]"
034.Gray_crowned_Rosy_Finch,Gray crowned Rosy Finch," Linaria tephrocotis Swainson, 1831[2] The gray-crowned rosy finch or gray-crowned rosy-finch (Leucosticte tephrocotis) is a species of passerine bird in the family Fringillidae native to Alaska, western Canada, and the north-western United States.  Due to its remote and rocky alpine habitat it is rarely seen. There are currently six recognized subspecies. It is one of four species of rosy finches. The gray-crowned rosy finch was first classified by English ornithologist William Swainson in 1832.[1] This bird has been thought to form a superspecies with three other rosy finches (also known as mountain finch): black rosy finch (L. atrata) and the brown-capped rosy finch (L. australis), all of which were classified as the same species as the Asian rosy finch (L. arctoa) from 1983 to 1993.[3][4][5] Recent mitochondrial DNA evidence shows the rosy finches are all indeed very closely related and can be easily confused with one another.[6] Along with one Asian rosy finch and two Asian mountain finches, the three North American rosy finches form the mountain finch genus Leucosticte. Alternative common names include: Roselin à tête grise (in French), Schwarzstirn-Schneegimpel (in German), and Pinzón Montano Nuquigrís (in Spanish).[7] Six subspecies of the gray-crowned rosy finch are now recognized, though proposals for additional subspecies have been recognized.[7]"
035.Purple_Finch,Purple Finch,"The purple finch (Haemorhous purpureus) is a bird in the finch family, Fringillidae. It breeds in the northern United States, southern Canada, and the west coast of North America. The purple finch was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus's Systema Naturae. He placed it with the finches in the genus Fringilla and coined the binomial name Fringilla purpurea. Gmelin specified the locality as Carolina.[2][3] Gmelin based his account on the ""purple finch"" that had been described and illustrated by the English naturalist Mark Catesby in his book The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands.[4] The purple finch is now one of three finches placed in the genus Haemorhous that was introduced in 1837 by the English naturalist William Swainson.[5] Two subspecies are recognised:[5] This species and the other ""American rosefinches"" were formerly included with the rosefinches of Eurasia in the genus Carpodacus; however, the three North American species are not closely related to the rosefinches of the Old World, and have thus been moved to the genus Haemorhous.[5][6]"
036.Northern_Flicker,Northern Flicker," The northern flicker or common flicker (Colaptes auratus) is a medium-sized bird of the woodpecker family. It is native to most of North America, parts of Central America, Cuba, and the Cayman Islands, and is one of the few woodpecker species that migrate. Over 100 common names for the northern flicker are known, including yellowhammer (not to be confused with the Eurasian yellowhammer (Emberiza citrinella)), clape, gaffer woodpecker, harry-wicket,[2] heigh-ho, wake-up, walk-up, wick-up, yarrup, and gawker bird. Many of these names derive from attempts to imitate some of its calls. It is the state bird of Alabama (known by its colloquial name ""yellowhammer"").[3] The English naturalist Mark Catesby described and illustrated the northern flicker in his book The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands which was published between 1729 and 1732. Catesby used the English name ""Gold-winged Wood-pecker"" and the Latin Picus major alis aureis.[4] When in 1758 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the tenth edition, he included the northern flicker, coined the binomial name Cuculus auratus and cited Catesby's book.[5] The specific epithet auratus is a Latin word meaning ""gilded"" or ""ornamented with gold"".[6] The type locality is South Carolina.[7] The northern flicker is one of 13 extant New World woodpeckers now placed in the genus Colaptes that was introduced by the Irish zoologist Nicholas Aylward Vigors in 1825 with the northern flicker (Colaptes auratus) as the type species.[8] Ten subspecies are recognized, one of which is now extinct, though it may be invalid.[9] The extant subspecies were at one time considered subspecies of two separate species called the yellow-shafted flicker (C. auratus, with four subspecies) and the red-shafted flicker (C. cafer, with six subspecies, five living and one extinct), but they commonly interbreed where their ranges overlap and are now considered one species by the American Ornithologists Union. This is an example of what is referred to in science as the species problem."
037.Acadian_Flycatcher,Acadian Flycatcher,The Acadian flycatcher (Empidonax virescens) is a small insect-eating bird of the tyrant flycatcher family.
038.Great_Crested_Flycatcher,Great Crested Flycatcher,"The great crested flycatcher (Myiarchus crinitus) is a large insect-eating bird of the tyrant flycatcher family. It is the most widespread member of the genus Myiarchus in North America, and is found over most of the eastern and mid-western portions of the continent.[2] It dwells mostly in the treetops and rarely is found on the ground.[3] The great crested flycatcher was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae. He placed it with the thrushes in the genus Turdus and coined the binomial name Turdus crinitus.[4][5] The specific epithet crinitus is Latin and means ""long-haired"" (from crinis meaning ""hair"")[6] Linnaeus based his account on the ""crested fly-catcher"" that had been described and illustrated by the English naturalist Mark Catesby in his book The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands.[7] Linnaeus specified the type locality as ""America"" but this was restricted to South Carolina by Outram Bangs in 1898.[8] It is now one of 22 species placed in the genus Myiarchus that was introduced by the German ornithologist Jean Cabanis in 1844. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.[9]"
039.Least_Flycatcher,Least Flycatcher," The least flycatcher (Empidonax minimus) (also called chebec, or chebecker, after the sound it makes) is a small insect-eating bird. It is the smallest Empidonax flycatcher in eastern North America. The closest relative to the least flycatcher was long thought to be the Hammond's flycatcher based on similarities in their songs and appearances.[2][3] However, mitochondrial DNA analysis has revealed that the least flycatcher diverges significantly from its congeners and does not possess any sister taxa.[4]"
040.Olive_sided_Flycatcher,Olive sided Flycatcher," The olive-sided flycatcher (Contopus cooperi) is a small to medium sized passerine bird in the family Tyrannidae, the Tyrant flycatcher family. It is a migratory species that travels from South to North America to breed during the summer. It is a very agile flyer and mainly consumes flying insects on flight. Since 2016, this species has been assessed as being near-threatened globally (IUCN) and threatened in Canada (SRA) due to its declining populations."
041.Scissor_tailed_Flycatcher,Scissor tailed Flycatcher,"The scissor-tailed flycatcher (Tyrannus forficatus), known as swallow-tailed flycatcher or scissorstail, is a long-tailed insectivorous bird of the genus Tyrannus, whose members are collectively referred to as kingbirds. Its scientific name used to be Muscivora forficata until it was changed to Tyrannus forficatus. It is found in North and Central America, and is Oklahoma's State Bird. The scissor-tailed flycatcher was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus's Systema Naturae. He placed it with the flycatchers in the genus Muscicapa and coined the binomial name Muscicapa forficata.[2][3] The specific epithet is from Latin forfex, forficis meaning ""a pair of scissors"".[4] Gmelin based his description on ""Le moucherolle à queue fourchue du Mexique"" (French: ""the Mexican swallow-tailed flycatcher"") that had been described in 1778 by the French polymath Comte de Buffon from a specimen from Mexico and illustrated with a hand-coloured engraving by François-Nicolas Martinet.[5][6] The scissor-tailed flycatcher is now one of 13 species placed in the kingbird genus Tyrannus that was introduced in 1799 by Bernard Germain de Lacépède.[7] The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.[7] Within the genus Tyrannus, the scissor-tailed flycatcher is most closely related to the western kingbird (Tyrannus verticalis).[8] In eastern Arkansas and western Tennessee, there is a hybrid breeding zone where the scissor-tailed flycatcher and the western kingbird are sympatric and possibly compete for the same niche.[9] Both these species have simultaneously expanded their breeding ranges eastward over the past 50 years."
042.Vermilion_Flycatcher,Vermilion Flycatcher,"The vermilion flycatcher (Pyrocephalus obscurus) is a small passerine bird in the tyrant flycatcher family found throughout South America and southern North America. It is a striking exception among the generally drab Tyrannidae due to its vermilion-red coloration. The males have bright red crowns, chests, and underparts, with brownish wings and tails. Females lack the vivid red coloration and can be hard to identify—they may be confused for the Say's phoebe. The vermilion flycatcher's song is a pit pit pit pidddrrrreeedrr, which is variable and important in establishing a territory. Riparian habitats and semi-open environments are preferred. As aerial insectivores, they catch their prey while flying. Their several months-long molt begins in summer. Despite being socially monogamous, vermilion flycatchers will engage in extra-pair copulation. They also practice within-species brood parasitism, whereby females lay their eggs in the nest of another individual. Females build shallow open cup nests and incubate the brown-speckled whitish eggs. The male feeds the female during incubation. Two broods of two or three eggs are laid in a season lasting from March through June. Once hatched, both males and females feed the chicks, which are ready to fledge after 15 days. The species was first described in the late 1830s as a result of the voyages of Charles Darwin. The taxonomy of the genus Pyrocephalus was revised in 2016, which led to the identification of several new species from the vermilion flycatcher's subspecies, including the now-extinct San Cristóbal flycatcher. Populations have declined because of habitat loss, though the species remains abundant. The overall population numbers are in the millions, thus the International Union for Conservation of Nature considers it a species of least concern."
043.Yellow_bellied_Flycatcher,Yellow bellied Flycatcher,The yellow-bellied flycatcher (Empidonax flaviventris) is a small insect-eating bird of the tyrant flycatcher family.
044.Frigatebird,Frigatebird,"Frigatebirds are a family of seabirds called Fregatidae which are found across all tropical and subtropical oceans. The five extant species are classified in a single genus, Fregata. All have predominantly black plumage, long, deeply forked tails and long hooked bills. Females have white underbellies and males have a distinctive red gular pouch, which they inflate during the breeding season to attract females. Their wings are long and pointed and can span up to 2.3 metres (7.5 ft), the largest wing area to body weight ratio of any bird. Able to soar for weeks on wind currents, frigatebirds spend most of the day in flight hunting for food, and roost on trees or cliffs at night. Their main prey are fish and squid, caught when chased to the water surface by large predators such as tuna. Frigatebirds are referred to as kleptoparasites as they occasionally rob other seabirds for food, and are known to snatch seabird chicks from the nest. Seasonally monogamous, frigatebirds nest colonially. A rough nest is constructed in low trees or on the ground on remote islands. A single egg is laid each breeding season. The duration of parental care is among the longest of any bird species; frigatebirds are only able to breed every other year. The Fregatidae are a sister group to Suloidea which consists of cormorants, darters, gannets, and boobies. Three of the five extant species of frigatebirds are widespread (the magnificent, great and lesser frigatebirds), while two are endangered (the Christmas Island and Ascension Island frigatebirds) and restrict their breeding habitat to one small island each. The oldest fossils date to the early Eocene, around 50 million years ago. Classified in the genus Limnofregata, the three species had shorter, less-hooked bills and longer legs, and lived in a freshwater environment."
045.Northern_Fulmar,Northern Fulmar,"The northern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis), fulmar,[2] or Arctic fulmar[3] is an abundant seabird found primarily in subarctic regions of the North Atlantic and North Pacific oceans. There has been one confirmed sighting in the Southern Hemisphere, with a single bird seen south of New Zealand.[4] Fulmars come in one of two colour morphs; a light one in temperate populations, with white head and body and grey wings and tail, and a dark one in arctic populations, which is uniformly grey; intermediate birds are common.[5] Though similar in appearance to gulls, fulmars are in fact members of the family Procellariidae, which includes petrels and shearwaters. The northern fulmar and its sister species, the southern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialoides), are the only extant members of the genus Fulmarus. The fulmars are in turn a member of the order Procellariiformes, and they all share certain identifying features. First, they have nasal passages that attach to the upper bill called naricorns; however, nostrils on albatrosses are on the sides of the bill, as opposed to the rest of the order, including fulmars, which have nostrils on top of the upper bill. The bills of Procellariiformes are also unique in that they are split into between seven and nine horny plates. One of these plates makes up the hooked portion of the upper bill, called the maxillary unguis. They produce a stomach oil made up of wax esters and triglycerides that is stored in the proventriculus. This can be sprayed out of their mouths as a defense against predators from a very early age, and as an energy rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights.[6] It will mat the plumage of avian predators, and can lead to their death.[7] Finally, they also have a salt gland that is situated above the nasal passage that helps desalinate their bodies, due to the high amount of ocean water that they imbibe. This gland excretes a high saline solution from their nose.[7] The northern fulmar was first described as Procellaria glacialis by Carl Linnaeus in 1761, based on a specimen from within the Arctic Circle, on Spitsbergen.[3] The Mallemuk Mountain in Northeastern Greenland is named after the northern fulmar (Danish: Mallemuk). The northern fulmar was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1761 in the second edition of his book Fauna Svecica. He placed it with the other petrels in the genus Procellaria and coined the binomial name Procellaria glacialis.[8] Linnaeus based his description mainly on the ""Mallemucke"" that had been described and illustrated in 1675 by the German naturalist Friderich Martens in his account of his voyage to Spitzbergen.[9][10] The northern fulmar is now placed in the genus Fulmarus that was introduced in 1826 by the English naturalist James Stephens.[11][12] The genus name comes from the Old Norse Fúlmár meaning ""foul-mew"" or ""foul-gull"" because of the birds' habit of ejecting a foul-smelling oil. The specific epithet glacialis is Latin for ""icy"".[13] Three subspecies are recognised:[12]"
046.Gadwall,Gadwall," The gadwall (Mareca strepera) is a common and widespread dabbling duck[2] in the family Anatidae. The gadwall was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae.[3] DNA studies have shown that it is a sister species with the falcated duck; the two are closely related to the three species of wigeons, and all of them have been assigned to the genus Mareca.[4][5] There are two subspecies:[6] The specific name strepera is Late Latin for ""noisy"".[8] The etymology of the word gadwall is not known, but the name has been in use since 1666.[9]"
047.American_Goldfinch,American Goldfinch,"The American goldfinch (Spinus tristis) is a small North American bird in the finch family. It is migratory, ranging from mid-Alberta to North Carolina during the breeding season, and from just south of the Canada–United States border to Mexico during the winter.

The only finch in its subfamily to undergo a complete molt, the American goldfinch displays sexual dichromatism: the male is a vibrant yellow in the summer and an olive color during the winter, while the female is a dull yellow-brown shade which brightens only slightly during the summer. The male displays brightly colored plumage during the breeding season to attract a mate.

The American goldfinch is a granivore and adapted for the consumption of seedheads, with a conical beak to remove the seeds and agile feet to grip the stems of seedheads while feeding. It is a social bird and will gather in large flocks while feeding and migrating. It may behave territorially during nest construction, but this aggression is short-lived. Its breeding season is tied to the peak of food supply, beginning in late July, which is relatively late in the year for a finch. This species is generally monogamous and produces one brood each year.

Human activity has generally benefited the American goldfinch. It is often found in residential areas because it is attracted to bird feeders, which increase its survival rate in these areas. Deforestation also creates open meadow areas, which are its preferred habitat."
048.European_Goldfinch,European Goldfinch,"The European goldfinch or simply the goldfinch (Carduelis carduelis) is a small passerine bird in the finch family that is native to the Palearctic zone in Europe, northern Africa, and western Asia. It has been introduced to other areas, including Australia, New Zealand, Uruguay and the United States. The breeding male has a red face with black markings around the eyes, and a black-and-white head. The back and flanks are buff or chestnut brown. The black wings have a broad yellow bar. The tail is black and the rump is white. Males and females are very similar, but females have a slightly smaller area of red on the face. The goldfinch is often depicted in Italian Renaissance paintings of the Madonna and Child. The European goldfinch was one of the birds described and illustrated by Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner in his Historiae animalium of 1555.[2] The first formal description was by Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of his Systema Naturae published in 1758. He introduced the binomial name, Fringilla carduelis.[3][4] Carduelis is the Latin word for 'goldfinch'.[5] The European goldfinch is now placed in the genus Carduelis that was introduced by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760 by tautonomy based on Linnaeus's specific epithet.[6][7] Modern molecular genetic studies have shown that the European goldfinch is closely related to the grey-crowned goldfinch (Carduelis caniceps), the citril finch (Carduelis citrinella) and the Corsican finch (Carduelis corsicana).[8] The English word 'goldfinch' was used in the second half of the 14th century by Geoffrey Chaucer in his unfinished The Cook's Tale: ""Gaillard he was as goldfynch in the shawe (Gaily dressed he was as is a goldfinch in the woods)"".[9] Ten subspecies of the European goldfinch are now accepted following the split of the grey-headed caniceps group as a separate species.[10][11] The former caniceps group of subspecies, containing subspecies C. c. caniceps, C. c. paropanisi, C. c. subulata, and C. c. ultima, were shifted to a separate species, the grey-crowned goldfinch, by the International Ornithological Congress in 2023. The European goldfinch originated in the late Miocene-Pliocene and belongs to the clade of cardueline finches. The grey-crowned goldfinch, citril finch and Corsican finch are its sister taxa. Their closest relatives are the greenfinches, crossbills and redpolls.[12] The monophyly of the subfamily Carduelinae is suggested in previous studies.[13]"
049.Boat_tailed_Grackle,Boat tailed Grackle," The boat-tailed grackle (Quiscalus major) is a passerine bird of the family Icteridae found as a permanent resident on the coasts of the Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic United States. The boat-tailed grackle is found in coastal saltwater marshes and, in Florida, also on inland waters.[2] In salt marsh areas, least bitterns will often associate with and make mixed colonies with grackles.[3] Boat-tailed grackles have established significant populations in several United States Gulf Coast cities and towns, [citation needed] where they can be found foraging in trash bins, dumpsters, and parking lots. The nest is a well-concealed cup in trees or shrubs near water; the average clutch size is just over three eggs.[4]"
050.Eared_Grebe,Eared Grebe,"The black-necked grebe or eared grebe (Podiceps nigricollis) is a member of the grebe family of water birds. It was described in 1831 by Christian Ludwig Brehm. Its breeding plumage features distinctive ochre-coloured feathers which extend behind its eye and over its ear coverts. The rest of the upper parts, including the head, neck, and breast, are coloured black to blackish brown. The flanks are tawny rufous to maroon-chestnut, and the abdomen is white. In its non-breeding plumage, this bird has greyish-black upper parts, including the top of the head and a vertical stripe on the back of the neck. The flanks are also greyish-black. The rest of the body is a white or whitish colour. The juvenile has more brown in its darker areas. This species is present in parts of Africa, Eurasia, and the Americas.

The black-necked grebe uses multiple foraging techniques. Insects, which make up the majority of this bird's diet, are caught either on the surface of the water or when they are in flight; this species occasionally practices foliage gleaning. This grebe dives to catch crustaceans, molluscs, tadpoles, and small frogs and fish. When moulting at saline lakes, this bird feeds mostly on brine shrimps. The black-necked grebe makes a floating cup nest on an open lake. The nest cup is covered with a disc. This nest is located both in colonies and by itself. During the breeding season, which varies depending on location, this species will lay one (sometimes two) clutch of three to four eggs. The number of eggs is sometimes larger due to conspecific brood parasitism. After a 21-day incubation period, the eggs hatch, and then the nest is deserted. After about 10 days, the parents split up the chicks between themselves. After this, the chicks become independent in about 10 days, and fledge in about three weeks.

Although it generally avoids flight, the black-necked grebe travels as far as 6,000 kilometres (3,700 mi) during migration. In addition, it becomes flightless for at least a month after completing a migration to reach an area where it can moult safely. During this moult, the grebe can double in weight. The migration to reach these areas can be dangerous, sometimes with thousands of grebe deaths. In spite of this, it is classified as a least concern species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It is likely that this is the most numerous grebe in the world. There are potential threats to it, such as oil spills, but these are not likely to present a major risk to the overall population."
051.Horned_Grebe,Horned Grebe," The horned grebe or Slavonian grebe (Podiceps auritus) is a relatively small and threatened species of waterbird in the family Podicipedidae.[1] There are two subspecies, P. a. auritus (Slavonian grebe), which breeds in Eurasia, and P. a. cornutus (horned grebe), which breeds in North America.[2][3][4] The Eurasian subspecies is distributed over most of northern Europe and northern Asia, breeding from Iceland east to the Russian Far East.[5] The North American subspecies spans most of Canada and some of the United States.[6] A small population was cited in Greenland in 1973,[5] but is not mapped or further mentioned by subsequent authors.[2][4][3] The American name 'horned' refers to the orange-yellow crest feathers located above and behind the eyes, called ""horns"". The English name, originally 'Sclavonian', is first attested by George Montagu in his 1802 Ornithological Dictionary,[7] from Sclavonia, an old name for northern Prussia, referring to the species' main breeding area in Europe;[8] the spelling was emended (without any reason given) to the current 'Slavonian' by Hartert in 1912.[9] The horned grebe was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae under the binomial name Colymbus auritus.[10] Linnaeus specified the type locality as Europe and America but this has been restricted to Vaasa in Finland.[11] The horned grebe is now one of the nine species placed in the genus Podiceps that was introduced in 1787 by the English naturalist John Latham.[12] The genus name combines the Latin podex meaning ""vent"" and pes meaning ""foot"". The specific epithet auritus is Latin meaning ""-eared"" or ""long-eared"", and the subspecific name cornutus means ""horned"".[13]"
052.Pied_billed_Grebe,Pied billed Grebe,"The pied-billed grebe (Podilymbus podiceps) is a species of the grebe family of water birds primarily found in ponds throughout the Americas.[2] The pied-billed grebe was described by Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of his Systema Naturae in 1758 as Colymbus podiceps.[3] The binomial name is derived from Latin Podilymbus, a contraction of podicipes (""feet at the buttocks"", from podici-, ""rump-"" + pes, ""foot"")—the origin of the name of the grebe order—and Ancient Greek kolymbos, ""diver"", and podiceps, ""rump-headed"", from podici- + Neo-Latin ceps.[4] Other names of this grebe include American dabchick, rail, dabchick, Carolina grebe, devil-diver, dive-dapper, dipper, hell-diver, pied-billed dabchick, pied-bill, thick-billed grebe, and water witch.[5][6] Since the extinction of the Atitlán grebe (Podilymbus gigas), the pied-billed grebe has become the sole extant member of the genus Podilymbus.[7] Outside its own genus, the closest relatives of the pied-billed grebe are the small grebes of the genus Tachybaptus.[8]"
053.Western_Grebe,Western Grebe," The western grebe[2] (Aechmophorus occidentalis)[3] is a species in the grebe family of water birds. Folk names include ""dabchick"", ""swan grebe"" and ""swan-necked grebe"". Western grebe fossils from the Late Pleistocene of southwest North America were described as a distinct species,[4] but later ranked as a paleosubspecies Aechmophorus occidentalis lucasi.[5] More recent study found them to fall within the variation now known to exist in today's birds.[6][7]"
054.Blue_Grosbeak,Blue Grosbeak," The blue grosbeak (Passerina caerulea), is a medium-sized North American passerine bird in the cardinal family Cardinalidae. It is mainly migratory, wintering in Central America and breeding in northern Mexico and the southern United States. The male is blue with two brown wing bars. The female is mainly brown with scattered blue feathers on the upperparts and two brown wing bars. The blue grosbeak was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae under the binomial name Loxia caerulea.[2] The specific epithet caerulea is the Latin word for ""blue"", ""azure-blue"", ""sky-blue"" or ""dark-blue"".[3] Linnaeus based his own description on the ""blew gross-beak"" described and illustrated by Mark Catesby in his The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands. The book had been published in 1729–1732.[4] Catesby gave the location as Carolina and Linnaeus specified America. The type location is now restricted to South Carolina.[5] Some taxonomists placed the blue grosbeak in its own monotypic genus Guiraca but in 2001 a molecular phylogenetic study of mitochondrial DNA sequences found that the blue grosbeak, in spite of being physically larger, nested within the Passerina and was most closely related to the lazuli bunting.[6] The species is therefore now placed with the North American buntings in Passerina, a genus that was introduced by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot in 1816.[7][8] Seven subspecies are recognised:[8]"
055.Evening_Grosbeak,Evening Grosbeak,"The evening grosbeak (Hesperiphona vespertina) is a passerine bird in the finch family Fringillidae found in North America. The evening grosbeak is bulky, with a large bill and short tail. The bird has a distinct appearance, with the adult male featuring a bright yellow forehead and body, brown head, and white wing patches, while the adult female has a mainly olive-brown body with greyer underparts and white wing patches. The evening grosbeak breeds in coniferous and mixed forests across Canada, the western mountainous areas of the United States, and Mexico. Its migration pattern is variable, sometimes reaching as far south as the southern U.S. in winters. These birds forage in trees and bushes, and their diet mainly consists of seeds, berries, and insects. The bird's range has expanded eastward in historical times, likely due to the planting of Manitoba maples and other shrubs near farms and the availability of bird feeders during winter. The evening grosbeak was formally described in 1825 by the American naturalist William Cooper and given the binomial name Fringilla vespertina. Cooper had been sent a specimen by the ethnologist Henry Schoolcraft that had been collected in the evening near Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. Cooper recorded the name of the bird in the Ojibwe language as ""Paushkundamo"".[2][3] The IOC checklist and the Handbook of the Birds of the World place the evening grosbeak and the closely related hooded grosbeak in the genus Hesperiphona.[4][5] However, the Clements Checklist and the AOS checklist place the evening and hooded grosbeaks in the genus Coccothraustes with the hawfinch.[6][7] The genus Hesperiphona was introduced by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1850.[8] The name is from Ancient Greek hesperos meaning ""evening"" and phōnē meaning ""sound"" or ""cry"". The specific epithet is from Latin vespertinus meaning ""of evening"", ""of twilight"" or ""crepuscular"".[9] Three subspecies are recognised:[4]"
056.Pine_Grosbeak,Pine Grosbeak,"The pine grosbeak (Pinicola enucleator) is a large member of the true finch family, Fringillidae. It is the only species in the genus Pinicola. It is found in coniferous woods across Alaska, the western mountains of the United States, Canada, and in subarctic Fennoscandia and across the Palearctic to Siberia. The species is a frugivore, especially in winter, favoring small fruits, such as rowans (mountain-ashes in the New World). With fruit-crop abundance varying from year to year, pine grosbeak is one of many subarctic-resident bird species that exhibit irruptive behavior. In irruption years, individuals can move long distances in search of suitable food supplies, bringing them farther south and/or downslope than is typical of years with large fruit crops. The pine grosbeak was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae under the binomial name Loxia enucleator.[2] The type locality is Sweden.[3] It is now the only species placed in the genus Pinicola that was erected in 1808 by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot.[4][5] The generic name Pinicola combines the Latin pinus meaning ""pine tree"" and colere meaning ""to dwell""; the specific enucleator is from the Latin enucleare meaning ""to remove the kernel"".[6] The pine grosbeak is a sister taxon to the bullfinches of the genus Pyrrhula.[7] The crimson-browed finch (Carpodacus subhimachalus) was previously placed in the genus Pinicola. It was moved to the rosefinch genus Carpodacus based on results from phylogenetic studies of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences that were published in 2012 and 2013.[5][7][8] Eight subspecies are recognised:[5]"
057.Rose_breasted_Grosbeak,Rose breasted Grosbeak," The rose-breasted grosbeak (Pheucticus ludovicianus), colloquially called ""cut-throat"" due to its coloration,[2][3] is a large, seed-eating grosbeak in the cardinal family (Cardinalidae). It is primarily a foliage gleaner.[4] Males have black heads, wings, backs, and tails, and a bright rose colored patch on their white breast. Males and females exhibit marked sexual dimorphism. Breeding habitat consists of cool-temperate open deciduous woods throughout much of eastern North America, with migration to tropical America in winter. Rose-breasted grosbeaks have an average maximum lifespan of 7.3 years in the wild, and up to 24 years in captivity. Death in the wild is generally due to collision with objects (buildings, cars, etc.) and predation, to eggs, nestlings and adults. In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the rose-breasted grosbeak in his Ornithologie based on a specimen collected in Louisiana. He used the French name Le gros-bec de la Louisiane and the Latin Coccothraustes Ludoviciana.[5] Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature.[6] When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson.[6] One of these was the rose-breasted grosbeak. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name Loxia ludoviciana and cited Brisson's work.[7] This species is now placed in the genus Pheucticus that was introduced by the German naturalist Ludwig Reichenbach in 1850.[8][9] The species is monotypic.[9] The genus name Pheucticus is from Ancient Greek φευκτικός - pheuktikós, ""shy"", from φεύγω - pheúgo, ""to flee"", and the specific ludovicianus is from Neo-Latin and refers to Louisiana.[10]"
058.Pigeon_Guillemot,Pigeon Guillemot,"The pigeon guillemot (Cepphus columba) (/ˈɡɪlɪmɒt/) is a species of bird in the auk family, Alcidae. One of three species in the genus Cepphus, it is most closely related to the spectacled guillemot. There are five subspecies of the pigeon guillemot; all subspecies, when in breeding plumage, are dark brown with a black iridescent sheen and a distinctive wing patch broken by a brown-black wedge. Its non-breeding plumage has mottled grey and black upperparts and white underparts. The long bill is black, as are the claws. The legs, feet, and inside of the mouth are red. It closely resembles the black guillemot, which is slightly smaller and lacks the dark wing wedge present in the pigeon guillemot.

This seabird is found on North Pacific coastal waters, from Siberia through Alaska to California. The pigeon guillemot breeds and sometimes roosts on rocky shores, cliffs, and islands close to shallow water. In the winter, some birds move slightly south in the northernmost part of their range in response to advancing ice and migrate slightly north in the southern part of their range, generally preferring more sheltered areas.

This species feeds on small fish and marine invertebrates, mostly near the sea floor, that it catches by pursuit diving. Pigeon guillemots are monogamous breeders, nesting in small colonies close to the shore. They defend small territories around a nesting cavity, in which they lay one or two eggs. Both parents incubate the eggs and feed the chicks. After leaving the nest the young bird is completely independent of its parents. Several birds and other animals prey on the eggs and chicks.

The pigeon guillemot is considered to be a least concern species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature due to its large, stable population and wide range. Threats to this bird include climate change, introduced mammalian predators, and oil spills."
059.California_Gull,California Gull," The California gull (Larus californicus) is a medium-sized gull, smaller on average than the herring gull, but larger on average than the ring-billed gull (though it may overlap in size with both). Although named after California, it can be found annually across most of western North America, from the Canadian prairie provinces in the northeast and south through western Mexico."
060.Glaucous_winged_Gull,Glaucous winged Gull," The glaucous-winged gull (Larus glaucescens) is a large, white-headed gull. The genus name is from Latin Larus which appears to have referred to a gull or other large seabird. The specific glaucescens is Neo-Latin for ""glaucous"" from the Ancient Greek, glaukos, denoting the grey color of its wings.[2] The glaucous-winged gull is rarely found far from the ocean. It is a resident from the western coast of Alaska to the coast of Washington. These glaucous winged gulls can also be found in the Puget Sound region. It also breeds on the northwest coast of Alaska, in the summertime and in the Russian Far East.  During winter, they can be found along the coast of California, Oregon, Baja California, Baja California Sur, and Sonora.  Glaucous-winged gulls are thought to live about 15 years, but some live much longer; a bird in British Columbia, for example, lived for more than 21 years,[3] while one in the US state of Washington lived for at least 22 years, 9 months.[4] The longevity record though, is more than 37 years, for a bird banded as a chick in British Columbia.[5] It is an exceptionally rare vagrant to the Western Palearctic region, with records from Morocco, the Canary Islands and, most recently, from Ireland in February and March 2016. It has also been recorded in Britain in the winters of 2006/2007 and 2008/2009. The 2008/2009 record was from Saltholme Pools, Cleveland, and attracted hundreds of twitchers."
061.Heermann_Gull,Heermann's Gull," Heermann's gull (Larus heermanni) is a gull resident in the United States, Mexico and extreme southwestern British Columbia, nearly all nesting on Isla Rasa in the Gulf of California. They are usually found near shores or well out to sea, very rarely inland. The species is named after Adolphus Lewis Heermann, nineteenth-century explorer and naturalist.[2]"
062.Herring_Gull,American Herring Gull,"The American herring gull or Smithsonian gull (Larus smithsonianus or Larus argentatus smithsonianus) is a large gull that breeds in North America, where it is treated by the American Ornithological Society as a subspecies of herring gull (L. argentatus). Adults are white with gray back and wings, black wingtips with white spots, and pink legs. Immature birds are gray-brown and are darker and more uniform than European herring gulls, with a darker tail.  As is common with other gulls, they are colloquially referred to simply as seagulls. It occurs in a variety of habitats including coasts, lakes, rivers, parking lots and garbage dumps. Its broad diet includes invertebrates, fish, and many other items. It usually nests near water, laying around three eggs in a scrape on the ground. This gull was first described as a new species in 1862 by Elliott Coues based on a series of specimens from the Smithsonian Institution. It was later reclassified as a subspecies of the herring gull (Larus argentatus). The genus name is from Latin Larus, which refers to a gull or other large seabird. The species name smithsonianus commemorates English chemist James Smithson whose £100,000 bequest enabled the foundation of the institution that bears his name.[2] The taxonomy of the herring gull group is very complicated and much is still controversial and uncertain. A 2002 study suggested that the American herring gull is not closely related to European herring gulls, belonging instead to a separate clade of gulls.[3] Several authorities such as the Association of European Rarities Committees and British Ornithologists' Union now recognize it as a separate species. The BOU also includes the Vega gull (Larus vegae) of northeastern Asia within the American herring gull.[3] The American Ornithologists' Union has not adopted the split and continues to treat the American herring gull as a subspecies of Larus argentatus.[4][needs update]"
063.Ivory_Gull,Ivory Gull," The ivory gull (Pagophila eburnea) is a small gull, the only species in the genus Pagophila. It breeds in the high Arctic and has a circumpolar distribution through Greenland, northernmost North America, and Eurasia. The ivory gull was initially described by Constantine Phipps, 2nd Baron Mulgrave in 1774 as Larus eburneus from a specimen collected on Spitsbergen during his 1773 expedition towards the North Pole.[2] Johann Jakob Kaup later recognized the unique traits of the ivory gull and gave it a monotypic genus, Pagophila, in 1829.[2] Johan Ernst Gunnerus later gave the species a new specific name, Pagophila alba.[2][dubious – discuss] The genus name Pagophila is from  Ancient Greek pagos, ""sea-ice"", and philos, ""-loving"", and specific eburnea is Latin for ""ivory-coloured"", from ebur, ""ivory"".[3] Today some authors consider the ivory gull not deserving of its monotypic genus, instead choosing to merge it, along with the other monotypic gulls, back into Larus.[2] However, most authors have not chosen to do so. The ivory gull has no subspecies.[2] No fossil members of this genus are known.[4] This gull has traditionally been believed to be most closely related to either the kittiwakes, Sabine's gull, or Ross's gull.[2] It differs anatomically from the other genera by having a relatively short tarsometatarsus, a narrower os pubis, and potentially more flexibility in skull kinetic structure.[2] Structurally, it is most similar to the kittiwakes; however, recent genetic analysis based on mtDNA sequences shows that Sabine's gull is the ivory gull's closest relative, followed by the kittiwakes, with Ross's gull and swallow-tailed gull sharing a clade with these species.[2][5] Pagophila is maintained as a unique genus because of the bird's morphological, behavioral and ecological differences from these species.[2] Colloquial names from Newfoundland include slob gull (from ""slob"", a local name for drift ice) and ice partridge, from a vague resemblance to a ptarmigan.[6]"
064.Ring_billed_Gull,Ring billed Gull," The ring-billed gull (Larus delawarensis) is a medium-sized gull native to North America, breeding in Canada and the northern Contiguous United States, and wintering mainly in the United States and northern Mexico. The genus name is from Latin Larus which appears to have referred to a gull or other large seabird. The specific delawarensis refers to the Delaware River.[2]"
065.Slaty_backed_Gull,Slaty backed Gull," The slaty-backed gull (Larus schistisagus) is a large, white-headed gull that breeds on the north-eastern coast of the Palearctic, but travels widely during nonbreeding seasons. It is similar in appearance to the western gull and the glaucous-winged gull.  Another alternate name is  Pacific gull, though it also applies to a Southern Hemisphere species, L. pacificus. The genus name is from Latin larus, which appears to have referred to a gull or other large seabird. The specific schistisagus is from Neo-Latin schistus, ""slate"", and Latin sagus, ""cloak"".[2] The Slaty-backed Gull is native to the Pacific coast of northeastern Asia. Individuals have strayed to various places throughout North America, including New England and Texas.[3] On 3 November 2012, an individual was spotted in Finland. The species has only been spotted three times before in Europe.[4]"
066.Western_Gull,Western Gull," The western gull (Larus occidentalis) is a large white-headed gull that lives on the west coast of North America and the Pacific Ocean. The western gull ranges from British Columbia, Canada, to Baja California, Mexico.[2] It was previously considered conspecific with the yellow-footed gull (Larus livens) of the Gulf of California. The western gull is a large gull that can measure 55 to 68 cm (22 to 27 in) in total length, spans 130 to 144 cm (51 to 57 in) across the wings, and weighs 800 to 1,400 g (1.8 to 3.1 lb).[3][4] The average mass among a survey of 48 gulls of the species was 1,011 g (2.229 lb).[5] Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 38 to 44.8 cm (15.0 to 17.6 in), the bill is 4.7 to 6.2 cm (1.9 to 2.4 in) and the tarsus is 5.8 to 7.5 cm (2.3 to 3.0 in).[3] The western gull has a white head and body, and upperparts or mantle is dark grey. The head generally remains white year-round, developing little to no streaking in northern populations. It has a large and bulbous-tipped yellow bill with a red subterminal spot (this is the small spot near the end of the bill that chicks peck in order to stimulate feeding). The eye colour varies, averaging pale yellow in southern populations and darker in northern populations. It closely resembles the slaty-backed gull (Larus schistisagus) of Asia, but the latter species has paler eyes and deeper pink legs and eye orbitals. In the north of its range it forms a hybrid zone with its close relative the glaucous-winged gull (Larus glaucescens). Western gulls take approximately four years to reach their full plumage,[6] their layer of feathers and the patterns and colors on the feathers. In adult plumage, The largest western gull colony is on the Farallon Islands, located about 26 mi (40 km) west of San Francisco, California;[7] an estimated 30,000 gulls live in the San Francisco Bay area. Western gulls also live in the Oregon Coast.[8] Two subspecies are recognized, differentiated by the mantle and eye colouration.[9] The northern subspecies L. o. occidentalis is found between Central Washington and Central California, has dark grey upperparts. The southern subspecies L. o. wymani is found between central and southern California has a darker mantle (approaching that of the Great black-backed gull)  and has paler eyes on average. wymani has more advanced plumage development than occidentalis, and generally attains adult plumage by the third year.[3] The call of the Western gull is bright, piercing, and repetitive. The western gull is a year-round resident in California, Oregon, Baja California, and southern Washington. It is migratory, moving to northern Washington, British Columbia, and Baja California Sur to spend the nonbreeding season. The western gull rarely ventures more than approximately 100 miles inland, almost never very far from the ocean;[6] it is almost an exclusively marine gull. It nests on offshore islands and rocks along the coast, and on islands inside estuaries. A colony also exists on Ano Nuevo Island, then Anacapa Island and Santa Barbara Island in Channel Islands National Park, and Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay. In the colonies, long term pairs aggressively defend territories whose borders may shift slightly from year to year, but are maintained for the life of the male.[citation needed] Western gulls feed in pelagic environments and in intertidal environments. At sea, they take fish[7] and invertebrates like krill, squid and jellyfish. They are unable to dive and feed exclusively on the surface of the water. On land they feed on seal and  sea lion carcasses and roadkill, as well as cockles, starfish, limpets and snails in the intertidal zone. They also feed on human food refuse, in human-altered habitats including landfills, and take food given to them, or stolen from people at marinas, beaches and parks. Western gulls are known to be predatory, killing and eating the young of other birds, especially ducklings, and even the adults of some smaller bird species. Western gulls, including one who lived at Oakland's Lake Merritt are known for killing and eating pigeons (rock doves).  They will also snatch  fish from a cormorant's or pelican's mouth before it is swallowed.  The bird has also been observed directly pilfering milk from the elephant seal's teat.[10] A nest of vegetation is constructed inside the parent's territory and 3 eggs are laid. These eggs are incubated for a month. The chicks, once hatched, remain inside the territory until they have fledged. Chicks straying into the territory of another gull are liable to be killed by that territory's pair. Chick mortality is high, with on average one chick surviving to fledging. On occasion, abandoned chicks will be adopted by other gulls. Between Puget Sound in Washington and Northern Oregon, the western gull hybridizes frequently with the glaucous-winged gull, a cross referred to as the Olympic gull.[9] Hybrids between the two species are variable and may features of either parent species, they have paler mantles and wingtips paler than Western gulls but darker than Glaucous-winged gulls. Additionally, the nonbreeding plumage of hybrids typically has darker head markings than pure Western gulls, which have little to no streaking in their nonbreeding plumage.[3] The prevalence of 'Olympic gull' hybrids is an example of bounded hybrid superiority, where natural selection favours hybrids in areas of intermediate habitat. One study found that females paired with hybrid males have higher breeding success than pairs of the same species.[11] In the central part of the hybrid zone, clutch size was larger among pairs with hybrid males, many of which established breeding grounds in more vegetative cover than pure western gull males, which preferred sand habitat resulting in heavier predation. In the northern section of the hybrid zone, there was no difference in clutch size, but breeding success is higher due to the hybrids being more similar to western gulls in foraging behaviour, feeding more on fish than glaucous-winged gulls. Little evidence of assortative mating was observed, except for weak assortative mating among hybrids in absence of mixed species pairs. The western gull is currently not considered threatened. However, they have, for a gull, a restricted range. Numbers were greatly reduced in the 19th century by the taking of seabird eggs for the growing city of San Francisco. Western gull colonies also suffered from disturbance where they were turned into lighthouse stations, or, in the case of Alcatraz, a prison. Western gulls are very aggressive when defending their territories and consequently were persecuted by some as a menace. The automation of lighthouses and the closing of Alcatraz Prison allowed the species to reclaim parts of its range. They are currently vulnerable to climatic events like El Niño events and oil spills. Thousands of western gulls and chicks reside at the Anacapa Island in Channel Islands National Park. Western gulls have become a serious nuisance to the San Francisco Giants baseball team. Thousands of gulls fly over Oracle Park in San Francisco during late innings of games. They swarm the field, defecate on fans, and after games eat leftovers of stadium food in the seats; how the birds know when games are about to end is unknown. The gulls left while a red-tailed hawk visited the park in late 2011, but returned after the hawk disappeared. Federal law prohibits shooting the birds, and hiring a falconer would cost the Giants $8000 a game.[8] The western gull was one of the antagonists in Alfred Hitchcock's famous movie The Birds which was filmed in Bodega Bay, California."
067.Anna_Hummingbird,Anna Hummingbird," Anna's hummingbird (Calypte anna) is a North American species of hummingbird  named after Anna Masséna, Duchess of Rivoli. It is native to western coastal regions of North America. Until the late 20th century, Anna's hummingbirds migrated from locations as far north as Alaska and coastal British Columbia, returning south to breed in Baja California and Southern California. Since the 1970s, ornamental plants in residential areas along the Pacific coast and inland deserts provided expanded nectar and nesting sites, allowing the species to expand its breeding range to northern coastal regions without migrating. Year-round residence of Anna's hummingbirds in the Pacific Northwest is an example of ecological release dependent on acclimation to colder winter temperatures, introduced plants, and human provision of nectar feeders during winter. These birds feed on nectar from flowers using a long extendable tongue. They also consume small insects and other arthropods caught in flight or gleaned from vegetation. Anna's hummingbird was formally described and illustrated in 1829 by the French naturalist René Lesson in his Histoire naturelle des Oiseaux-Mouches from a specimen that had been collected in California. Lesson placed it in the genus Ornismya and coined the binomial name Ornismya anna.[2][3] Anna's hummingbird is now placed in the genus Calypte that was introduced in 1856 by the English ornithologist John Gould.[4][5] Gould did not explain the derivation of the genus name but it is probably from the Ancient Greek kaluptrē meaning ""woman’s veil"" or ""head-dress"" (from kaluptō meaning ""to cover""). The specific epithet anna was chosen to honour Anne d'Essling who married the ornithologist François Victor Massena, 3rd Duke of Rivoli.[6] The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.[5]"
068.Ruby_throated_Hummingbird,Ruby throated Hummingbird,"The ruby-throated hummingbird (Archilochus colubris) is a species of hummingbird that generally spends the winter in Central America, Mexico, and Florida, and migrates to Canada and other parts of Eastern North America for the summer to breed. It is the most common hummingbird in eastern North America, having population estimates of about 35 million in 2021. The ruby-throated hummingbird was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae under the binomial name Trochilus colubris.[3] Linnaeus based his description on the earlier account by Mark Catesby in his The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands that had been published in 1729 and that by George Edwards in his A Natural History of Uncommon Birds that had been published in 1743.[4][5] The type locality is South Carolina.[6] The specific epithet colubris is from the Spanish colibrí meaning ""hummingbird"".[7] The ruby-throated hummingbird is now placed in the genus Archilochus that was introduced in 1854 by the German naturalist Ludwig Reichenbach.[8][9] The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.[9]"
069.Rufous_Hummingbird,Rufous Hummingbird," The rufous hummingbird (Selasphorus rufus) is a small hummingbird, about 8 cm (3 in) long with a long, straight and slender bill. These birds are known for their extraordinary flight skills, flying 3,200 kilometres (2,000 miles) during their migratory transits. It is one of nine species in the genus Selasphorus. The rufous hummingbird was formally described in 1788 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus's Systema Naturae. He placed it with all the other hummingbirds in the genus Trochilus and coined the binomial name Trochilus rufus.[3] Gmelin based his description on the ruff-necked hummingbird described by John Latham in 1782 and the ruffed honeysucker described by Thomas Pennant in 1785.[4][5] The type locality given by Gmelin was Nootka Sound on the west coast of Vancouver Island in western Canada, although breeding was estimated to occur in northwestern North America and wintering in westcentral Mexico.[6] The rufous hummingbird is now placed with eight other species in the genus Selasphorus that was introduced in 1832 by the English naturalist William Swainson.[7][8] The genus name combines the Ancient Greek selas meaning ""light"" or ""flame"" with -phoros meaning ""-carrying"".  The specific epithet rufus is the Latin word for ""red"".[9] The species is considered as monotypic: no subspecies are recognized.[8]"
070.Green_Violetear,Green Violetear," The Mexican violetear (Colibri thalassinus) is a medium-sized, metallic green hummingbird species commonly found in forested areas from Mexico to Nicaragua. This species, together with the lesser violetear were previously considered conspecific, and together called the green violetear. The Mexican violetear belongs to the order Apodiformes. Hummingbirds share this order with the swifts, such as the white-collared swift. The name Apodiformes is derived from the Greek words ""a pous"", meaning ""without foot"". While apodiforms do in fact have feet, they are quite small and their legs are short and relatively weak. Many birds in this order cannot walk, and thus rarely if ever land on the ground, where they are not well-adapted to forage or to escape from predators. Members of this order spend a majority of their active time in the air."
071.Long_tailed_Jaeger,Long tailed Jaeger," The long-tailed skua or long-tailed jaeger (Stercorarius longicaudus) is a seabird in the skua family Stercorariidae. The word ""jaeger"" is derived from the German word Jäger, meaning ""hunter"".[2] The English word ""skua"" comes from the Faroese name skúgvur [ˈskɪkvʊər] for the great skua, with the island of Skúvoy known for its colony of that bird. The general Faroese term for skuas is kjógvi [ˈtʃɛkvə].[3] The genus name Stercorarius is Latin and means ""of dung""; the food disgorged by other birds when pursued by skuas was once thought to be excrement. The specific longicaudus is from Latin longus, ""long"", and cauda, ""tail"".[4]"
072.Pomarine_Jaeger,Pomarine Jaeger," The pomarine jaeger (Stercorarius pomarinus), pomarine skua, or pomatorhine skua,[2] is a seabird in the skua family Stercorariidae. It is a migrant, wintering at sea in the tropical oceans. The Pomarine Jaeger is most closely related to the larger skuas (species formerly placed in a separate genus Catharacta: Great Skua, Chilean Skua, Brown Skua, and South Polar Skua)[3][4]. Together, the Pomarine Jaeger and the larger skuas are sister to the two smaller skua species, the Parasitic Jaeger and Long-tailed Jaeger[3][4]. The evolutionary relationships of the Pomarine Jaeger were formerly controversial. Based on plumage similarity between the Pomarine Jaeger and the two smaller jaegers (Long-tailed Jaeger and Parasitic Jaeger), the three jaegers were formerly placed in a separate genus from the larger skuas (with the jaegers in Stercorarius and the larger skuas in the former genus Catharacta). However, behavioural evidence was recognized early on as suggesting a link between the Pomarine Jaeger and the larger skuas: for example, both Pomarine Jaeger and Great Skuas perform wing-raising displays, a behaviour that is absent in the two smaller jaegers [5][4]. Skeletal data also hinted at a closer relationship between Pomarine Jaeger and the larger skuas[5][6]. Later, the mitochondrial DNA of the Pomarine Jaeger was found to be most similar to the Great Skua[7][4][8], not the smaller jaegers. Based on these patterns, it was proposed that the Pomarine Jaeger originated through hybridization between the Great Skua and either the Long-tailed or Parasitic Jaeger; or alternatively, that the Great Skua originated through hybridization of the Pomarine Jaeger and one of the southern hemisphere skuas [7][9][4][8]. Under the hybrid origin scenarios, the hybrid population would have eventually evolved into a distinct species. Whole genome sequencing later revealed that the mitochondrial DNA similarity between the Pomarine Jaeger and the Great Skua was most likely due to hybrid introgression from the Pomarine Jaeger into the Great Skua, with the mitochondrial DNA of the Pomarine Jaeger replacing that of the Great Skua[3]. The whole genome data rejected a hybrid origin for the Pomarine Jaeger, with no evidence of Parasitic Jaeger or Long-tailed Jaeger ancestry within the Pomarine Jaeger, but instead supported a low level of hybrid introgression between the Pomarine Jaeger and Great Skua [3]. The word ""jaeger"" is derived from the German word Jäger, meaning ""hunter"".[10][11] The genus name Stercorarius is Latin and means ""of dung""; the food disgorged by other birds when pursued by skuas was once thought to be excrement. The specific Pomatorhinus is from  Ancient Greek poma, pomatos, ""lid"" and rhis, rhinos,  ""nostrils"".[12] This refers to the cere, which the pomarine jaeger shares with the other skuas. Although it is sometimes erroneously referred to as the Pomeranian skua, the name of this species is unrelated to the Baltic Sea region of Pomerania.[2]"
073.Blue_Jay,Blue Jay,"The blue jay (Cyanocitta cristata) is a passerine bird in the family Corvidae, native to eastern North America. It lives in most of the eastern and central United States; some eastern populations may be migratory. Resident populations are also in Newfoundland, Canada; breeding populations are found across southern Canada. It breeds in both deciduous and coniferous forests, and is common in residential areas. Its coloration is predominantly blue, with a white chest and underparts, and a blue crest; it has a black, U-shaped collar around its neck and a black border behind the crest. Males and females are similar in size and plumage, which does not vary throughout the year. Four subspecies have been recognized.

The blue jay feeds mainly on seeds and nuts, such as acorns, which it may hide to eat later;[2] soft fruits; arthropods; and occasionally small vertebrates. It typically gleans food from trees, shrubs, and the ground, and sometimes hawks insects from the air. Blue jays can be very aggressive to other birds; they sometimes raid nests and have even been found to have decapitated other birds.[3]

It builds an open cup nest in the branches of a tree; both sexes participate. The clutch may be two to seven eggs, which are blueish or light brown with darker brown spots. Young are altricial, and are brooded by the female for 8–12 days after hatching. They may stay with their parents for one to two months.

The name jay derives from the bird's noisy, garrulous nature and has been applied to other birds of the same family, which are also mostly gregarious.[4] Jays are also called jaybirds.[5]"
074.Florida_Jay,Florida Jay," The Florida scrub jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens[A]) is one of the species of scrub jay native to North America. It is the only species of bird endemic to the U.S. state of Florida and one of only 15 species endemic to the continental United States.[4] Because of this, it is keenly sought by birders. It is known to have been present in Florida as a distinct species for at least 2 million years,[5] and is possibly derived from the ancestors of Woodhouse's scrub jay.[6]"
075.Green_Jay,Green Jay," The green jay (Cyanocorax luxuosus) is a species of the New World jays, found in Central America, Mexico, and South Texas. Adults are about 27 cm (11 in) long and variable in color across their range; they usually have blue and black heads, green wings and mantle, bluish-green tails, black bills, yellow or brown eye rings, and dark legs. The basic diet consists of arthropods, vertebrates, seeds, and fruit. The nest is usually built in a thorny bush; the female incubates the clutch of three to five eggs. This is a common species of jay with a wide range and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of ""least concern"". Seven subspecies are accepted; listed from north to south:[2] It differs from the related Inca jay of the Andes most obviously in lacking the large nasal bristles that form a distinct tuft at the base of the bill in that species, and also tends to show more blue on the rear crown.[3] Despite its separation from the Inca jay by a 1,600 km range gap, some ornithologists treat the green jay and Inca jay as conspecific, with the green jay as C. yncas luxuosus and the Inca jay as C. yncas yncas.[4][5]"
076.Dark_eyed_Junco,Dark eyed Junco," The dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis) is a species of junco, a group of small, grayish New World sparrows. The species is common across much of temperate North America and in summer it ranges far into the Arctic. It is a variable species, much like the related fox sparrow (Passerella iliaca), and its systematics are still not completely resolved. The dark-eyed junco was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae as Fringilla hyemalis. The description consisted merely of the laconic remark ""F[ringilla] nigra, ventre albo. (""A black 'finch' with white belly"") and a statement that it came from America.[2] Linnaeus based his description on the ""Snow-Bird"" that Mark Catesby had described and illustrated in his 1731 The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands.[3] The Bill of this Bird is white: The Breast and Belly white. All the rest of the Body black; but in some places dusky, inclining to Lead-color. In Virginia and Carolina they appear only in Winter: and in Snow they appear most. In Summer none are seen. Whether they retire and breed in the North (which is most probable) or where they go, when they leave these Countries in Spring, is to me unknown. [italics in original][3] The type locality was restricted to South Carolina by the American Ornithologists' Union in 1931.[4][5] The dark-eyed junco is now placed in the genus Junco that was introduced in 1831 by the German naturalist Johann Georg Wagler.[6][7] The genus name Junco is the Spanish word for rush, from the Latin word juncus.[8]  Its modern scientific name means ""winter junco"", from the Latin word hyemalis ""of the winter"".[9] Either 14 or 15 subspecies are recognized.[7] These subspecies are grouped in two or three large or polytypic groups and three or four small or monotypic ones, all depending on the authority. These groups were formerly considered separate species, but they interbreed extensively in areas of contact. Birders trying to identify subspecies are advised to consult detailed identification references.[10][11] These two or three subspecies have dark slate-gray heads, breasts and upperparts. Females are brownish-gray, sometimes with reddish-brown flanks.[10] They breed in the North American boreal forests from Alaska to Newfoundland and south to the Appalachian Mountains, wintering throughout most of the United States. They are relatively common across their range. This subspecies has a medium-gray head, breast, and upperparts with white wing bars. Females are washed brownish. It has more white in the tail than the other 14 subspecies. It is a common endemic breeder in the Black Hills of South Dakota, Wyoming, Nebraska, and Montana, and winters south to northeastern New Mexico.[12][10] These eight subspecies have blackish-gray heads and breasts with brown backs and wings and reddish flanks, tending toward duller and paler plumage in the inland and southern parts of its range.[11] Oregon dark-eyed juncos are also less commonly known as brown-backed dark-eyed juncos. This is the most common subspecies group in the West, breeding in the Pacific Coast Ranges from southeastern Alaska to extreme northern Baja California and wintering to the Great Plains and northern Sonora. An unresolved debate exists as to whether this large and distinct subspecies group is actually a separate species with eight (or nine, see below) subspecies of its own.[citation needed] Sometimes considered a ninth subspecies in the Oregon/brown-backed group, this subspecies has a lighter gray head and breast than the eight Oregon/brown-backed dark-eyed juncos, with contrasting dark lores. The back and wings are brown. It has a pinkish-cinnamon color that is richer and covers more of the flanks and breast than in the eight Oregon/brown-backed dark-eyed juncos. It breeds in the northern Rocky Mountains from southern Alberta to eastern Idaho and western Wyoming and winters in central Idaho and nearby Montana and from southwestern South Dakota, southern Wyoming, and northern Utah to northern Sonora and Chihuahua.[11] This subspecies is essentially rather light gray on top with a rusty back. It breeds in the southern Rocky Mountains from Colorado to central Arizona and New Mexico, and winters into northern Mexico.[12][10] Sometimes included with the gray-headed dark-eyed junco proper as part of the gray-headed group, this subspecies differs from it in having a more silvery bill[11] with a dark-colored upper mandible and a light-colored lower mandible,[12][10] a variable amount of rust on the wings, and pale underparts. This makes it similar to the yellow-eyed junco (Junco phaeonotus), except for the dark eyes. It is found in the southern mountains of Arizona and New Mexico.[10] It does not overlap with the yellow-eyed junco in its breeding range. The extremely rare Guadalupe junco (Junco insularis) was formerly considered to be a subspecies of this species (either included in the gray-headed group or placed in a seventh group of its own, the Guadalupe group), but is now treated as a separate species in its own right – perhaps a rather young one, but certainly this population has evolved more rapidly than the 14 or 15 subspecies of the dark-eyed junco on the mainland due to its small population size and the founder effect.[7]"
077.Tropical_Kingbird,Tropical Kingbird," The tropical kingbird (Tyrannus melancholicus) is a large tyrant flycatcher. This bird breeds from southern Arizona and the lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas in the United States through Central America, South America as far as south as central Argentina and eastern Peru, and on Trinidad and Tobago. Birds from the northernmost and southern breeding areas migrate to warmer parts of the range after breeding. The tropical kingbird  was formally described in 1819 by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot under the binomial name Tyrannus melancholicus.[2] Vieillot based his description on the Suirirí-Guazú that had been described by the Spanish naturalist Félix de Azara in 1805 in his book Apuntamientos para la historia natural de los páxaros del Paragüay y Rio de la Plata.[3][4] The specific epithet is Latin meaning ""melancholic"" (that is ""bad-tempered"").[5] Three subspecies are recognised:[6]"
078.Gray_Kingbird,Gray Kingbird," The gray kingbird or grey kingbird (Tyrannus dominicensis), also known as pitirre, petchary or white-breasted kingbird, is a passerine bird in the tyrant flycatchers family Tyrannidae. The species was first described on the island of Hispaniola, then called Santo Domingo, thus the dominicensis name. The gray kingbird was formally described in 1788 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus's Systema Naturae. He placed it with the shrikes in the genus Lanius and coined the binomial name Lanius dominicensis.[2][3] The specific epithet is from the locality Santo Domingo, now Hispaniola.[4] Gmelin based his description on ""Le tyran de S. Domingue"" that had been described and illustrated in 1760 by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson.[5] The gray kingbird is now one of 13 species placed in the kingbird genus Tyrannus that was introduced in 1799 by the French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lacépède.[6] A molecular genetic study published in 2020 found that the gray kingbird was sister to the giant kingbird (Tyrannus cubensis).[7] Two subspecies are recognised:[6]"
079.Belted_Kingfisher,Belted Kingfisher," The belted kingfisher (Megaceryle alcyon) is a large, conspicuous water kingfisher, native to North America. All kingfishers are placed in one family, Alcedinidae, and recent research suggests that this should be divided into three subfamilies. The first formal description of the belted kingfisher was by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae. He introduced the binomial name Alcedo alcyon.[2] The current genus Megaceryle was erected by the German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup in 1848.[3] Megaceryle is from the Ancient Greek megas, ""great"", and the existing genus Ceryle. The specific alcyon is Latin  for  ""kingfisher"".[4] The Megaceryle large green kingfishers were formerly placed in Ceryle with the pied kingfisher, but the latter is closer to the Chloroceryle American green kingfishers. The belted kingfisher's closest living relative is the ringed kingfisher (M. torquata), and these two in all probability originated from an African Megaceryle which colonized the Americas.[5]"
080.Green_Kingfisher,Green Kingfisher,"The green kingfisher (Chloroceryle americana) is a species of ""water kingfisher"" in the subfamily Cerylinae of the family Alcedinidae. It is found from southern Texas in the United States south through Central America, and in every mainland South American country except Chile. [2][3] The green kingfisher was formally described in 1788 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus's Systema Naturae. He placed it with the other kingfishers in the genus Alcedo and coined the binomial name Alcedo americana.[4] Gmelin based his description on ""Le martin-pêcheur vert et blanc"" from Cayenne that had been described and illustrated in 1780 by the French polymath Comte de Buffon and also the ""white and green kingfisher"" that had been described in 1782 by the English ornithologist John Latham.[5][6][7] The green kingfisher is now placed in the genus Chloroceryle that was introduced in 1848 by Johann Jakob Kaup.[8][9] A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2006 found that the green kingfisher is a sister species to the larger green-and-rufous kingfisher (C. inda).[10] Five subspecies are recognized:[9][11]  Some populations of C. a. septentrionalis have in the past been separated as subspecies C. a. vanrossemi and C. a. isthmica. The population of Trinidad and Tobago, usually included with C. a. americana, has in the past been treated as subspecies C. a. croteta. Other populations of C. a. americana have been suggested to be split as C. a. hellmayri and C. a. bottomeana. None of these subspecies are currently (2022) recognized by major worldwide taxonomic systems.[11][9][2][12]"
081.Pied_Kingfisher,Pied Kingfisher," The pied kingfisher (Ceryle rudis) is a species of water kingfisher widely distributed across Africa and Asia. Originally described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, it has five recognised subspecies. Its black and white plumage and crest, as well as its habit of hovering over clear lakes and rivers before diving for fish, make it distinctive. Males have a double band across the breast, while females have a single broken breast band. They are usually found in pairs or small family groups. When perched, they often bob their head and flick up their tail. The pied kingfisher was one of the many bird species originally described by Linnaeus in the landmark 1758 10th edition of his Systema Naturae, who noted that it lived in Persia and Egypt. He named it Alcedo rudis.[2] The German naturalist Friedrich Boie erected the genus Ceryle in 1828.[3] The name is from classical Greek kērulos, an unidentified and probably mythical bird mentioned by Aristotle and other authors. The specific epithet rudis is Latin for ""wild"" or ""rude"".[4] The pied kingfisher is the only member of the genus Ceryle. Molecular analysis shows it is an early offshoot of the lineage that gave rise to American kingfishers of the genus Chloroceryle.[5] The pied kingfisher was initially believed to be descended from an ancestral American green kingfisher which crossed the Atlantic Ocean about one million years ago.[6] A more recent suggestion is that the pied kingfisher and the American green kingfishers are derived from an Old World species, with the pied kingfisher or its ancestor losing the metallic colouration afterwards.[5] There are five subspecies:[7]"
082.Ringed_Kingfisher,Ringed Kingfisher," The ringed kingfisher (Megaceryle torquata) is a large, conspicuous, and noisy kingfisher bird commonly found along the lower Rio Grande Valley in southeasternmost Texas in the United States through Central America to Tierra del Fuego in South America.[4]"
083.White_breasted_Kingfisher,White breasted Kingfisher,"The white-throated kingfisher (Halcyon smyrnensis) also known as the white-breasted kingfisher is a tree kingfisher, widely distributed in Asia from the Sinai east through the Indian subcontinent to China and Indonesia. This kingfisher is a resident over much of its range, although some populations may make short distance movements. It can often be found well away from water where it feeds on a wide range of prey that includes small reptiles, amphibians, crabs, small rodents and even birds. During the breeding season they call loudly in the mornings from prominent perches including the tops of buildings in urban areas or on wires. The white-throated kingfisher is one of the many birds that were first formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae. He coined the binomial name Alcedo smyrnensis.[2][3] Linnaeus cited Eleazar Albin's Natural History of Birds published in 1738 that included a description and a plate of the ""Smirna Kingfisher"".[4] Albin's specimen was preserved in alcohol and had been collected by the botanist William Sherard who served as the British Consul at Smyrna between 1703 and 1716.[4][5] The present genus Halcyon was introduced by the English naturalist and artist William Swainson in 1821.[6] Halcyon is a name for a bird in Greek mythology  generally associated with the kingfisher. The specific epithet smyrnensis is an adjective for the city of Smyrna (now İzmir in Turkey).[7] Five subspecies are recognised:[8] The brown-breasted kingfisher (H. gularis) of the Philippines is usually now considered as a separate species.[9][10] Support for this treatment was provided by a molecular study published in 2017 that found that H. s. gularis was more closely related to the Javan kingfisher (H. cyanoventris) than it was to the white-throated kingfisher.[11] They were split as distinct species by the IUCN Red List and BirdLife International in 2014, and the International Ornithological Congress followed suit in 2022.[12] The races H. s. perpulchra and H. s. fokiensis are sometimes included in H. s. fusca.[13] Local names include Baluchistan: aspi chidok; Sindhi: dalel; Hindi: kilkila, kourilla; Himachal Pradesh: neela machhrala; Punjabi: wadda machhera; Bengali: sandabuk machhranga; Assamese: māsorokā, মাছৰোকা; Cachar: dao natu gophu; Gujarati: kalkaliyo, safedchati kalkaliyo; Marathi: khundya; Tamil: vichuli; Telugu: lakmuka, buchegadu; Malayalam: ponman; Kannada: Minchulli(ಮಿಂಚುಳ್ಳಿ),rajamatsi; Sinhalese: pilihuduwa.[14]"
084.Red_legged_Kittiwake,Red legged Kittiwake," The red-legged kittiwake (Rissa brevirostris) is a seabird species in the gull family Laridae. It breeds in the Pribilof Islands, Bogoslof Island, and Buldir Island in the Bering Sea off the coast of Alaska, and the Commander Islands, Russia, and spends the winter at sea."
085.Horned_Lark,Horned Lark,"The horned lark or shore lark (Eremophila alpestris) is a species of lark in the family Alaudidae found across the northern hemisphere. It is known as ""horned lark"" in North America and ""shore lark"" in Europe. The horned lark was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae under the binomial name Alauda alpestris.[2] Linnaeus based his account on the description and illustration by the English naturalist Mark Catesby in his book The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands that was published between 1729 and 1732.[3] Linnaeus specified the type locality as North America but this has been restricted to the coastal areas of South Carolina.[4] The horned lark is now placed together with Temminck's lark in the genus Eremophila that was introduced in 1828 by the German naturalist Friedrich Boie.[5][6] The specific epithet alpestris is Latin meaning ""of the high mountains"", from Alpes, the Alps.[7] A molecular genetic study of the Alaudidae published in 2023 found that Temminck's lark (Eremophila bilopha) was embedded in a clade containing taxa currently classed as subspecies of the horned lark.[8] The horned lark is suggested to have diverged from Temminck's lark (E. bilopha) around the Early-Middle Pleistocene, according to genomic divergence estimates.[9][10] The horned lark is known from around a dozen localities of Late Pleistocene age, including those in Italy,[11] Russia, The United Kingdom and the United States. The earliest known fossil is from the Calabrian of Spain, around 1–0.8 million years old.[12] In 2020, a 46,000 year old frozen specimen was described from the Russian Far East.[13] A 2014 genetic analysis suggested that the species consists of six clades that in the future may warrant recognition as separate species.[9] A 2020 study also suggested splitting of the species, but into 4 species instead, the Himalayan horned lark E. longirostris, mountain horned lark E. penicillata, common horned lark E. alpestris (sensu stricto), alongside Temminck's lark.[10] Forty-two subspecies are recognized:[6]"
086.Pacific_Loon,Pacific Loon," The Pacific loon or Pacific diver (Gavia pacifica), is a medium-sized member of the loon, or diver, family. The Pacific loon, previously considered conspecific with the similar black-throated loon, was classified as a separate species in 1985.[2][3] The genus name Gavia comes from the Latin for ""sea mew"", as used by ancient Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder.[4] The specific epithet pacifica is Latin for the Pacific Ocean, the term meaning ""peaceful"".[5] The phylogeny of this species is debated, with the black-throated loon and the Pacific loon traditionally being considered sister species, whereas a study using mitochondrial and nuclear intron DNA supported placing the black-throated loon sister to a clade consisting of the Pacific loon and the two sister species that are the common loon and the yellow-billed loon. In the former phylogeny, the split between the Pacific loon and the black-throated loon is proposed to have happened about 6.5 million years ago.[6]"
087.Mallard,Mallard,"The mallard (/ˈmælɑːrd, ˈmælərd/) or wild duck (Anas platyrhynchos) is a dabbling duck that breeds throughout the temperate and subtropical Americas, Eurasia, and North Africa. It has been introduced to New Zealand, Australia, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, the Falkland Islands, and South Africa. Belonging to the subfamily Anatinae of the waterfowl family Anatidae, mallards live in wetlands, eat water plants and small animals, and are social animals preferring to congregate in groups or flocks of varying sizes.

Males (drakes) have green heads, while the females (hens) have mainly brown-speckled plumage. Both sexes have an area of white-bordered black or iridescent purple or blue feathers called a speculum on their wings; males especially tend to have blue speculum feathers. The mallard is 50–65 cm (20–26 in) long, of which the body makes up around two-thirds the length. The wingspan is 81–98 cm (32–39 in) and the bill is 4.4 to 6.1 cm (1.7 to 2.4 in) long. It is often slightly heavier than most other dabbling ducks, weighing 0.7–1.6 kg (1.5–3.5 lb).

The female lays 8 to 13 creamy white to greenish-buff spotless eggs, on alternate days. Incubation takes 27 to 28 days and fledging takes 50 to 60 days. The ducklings are precocial and fully capable of swimming as soon as they hatch.

The non-migratory mallard interbreeds with indigenous wild ducks of closely related species through genetic pollution by producing fertile offspring. Complete hybridisation of various species of wild duck gene pools could result in the extinction of many indigenous waterfowl. This species is the main ancestor of most breeds of domestic duck, and its naturally evolved wild gene pool has been genetically polluted by the domestic and feral mallard populations.

The mallard is considered to be a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and, unlike many waterfowl, are considered an invasive species in some regions. It is a very adaptable species, being able to live and even thrive in urban areas which may have supported more localised, sensitive species of waterfowl before development."
088.Western_Meadowlark,Western Meadowlark," The western meadowlark (Sturnella neglecta) is a medium-sized icterid bird, about 8.5 in (22 cm) in length. It is found across western and central North America and is a full migrant, breeding in Canada and the United States with resident populations also found in Mexico.[1] The western meadowlark nests on the ground in open grasslands and shrublands.[1][2] It feeds on bugs and seeds.[3] The western meadowlark has distinctive calls described as watery or flute-like, which distinguish it from the closely related eastern meadowlark.[4] The western meadowlark is the state bird of six states: Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oregon, and Wyoming. The western meadowlark was formally described in 1844 by the American ornithologist John James Audubon under its current binomial name Sturnella neglecta.[5] The specific epithet is from the Latin neglectus meaning ""ignored"", ""overlooked"", ""neglected"" or ""disregarded"".[6] Audubon explained that although the account of the Lewis and Clark Expedition of 1803–1806 mentioned yellow larks, these had never been formally described.[5][7] The type locality is Old Fort Union, North Dakota.[8] Despite having ""lark"" in their name due to their melodic song, they are not true larks, as they are instead in the New World blackbird family.[9] Two subspecies are recognised:[10] Western meadowlarks will occasionally interbreed with eastern meadowlarks where their ranges overlap; however, resulting young appear to have low fertility.[11]"
089.Hooded_Merganser,Hooded Merganser,"  The hooded merganser (Lophodytes cucullatus) is a species of fish-eating duck in the subfamily Anatinae. It is the only extant species in the genus Lophodytes. The genus name derives from the Greek language: lophos meaning 'crest', and dutes meaning 'diver'. The bird is striking in appearance; both sexes have crests that they can raise or lower, and the breeding plumage of the male is handsomely patterned and coloured. The hooded merganser has a sawbill but is not classified as a typical merganser. Hooded mergansers are the second-smallest species of merganser, with only the smew of Europe and Asia being smaller, and it also is the only merganser whose native habitat is restricted to North America. A species of fossil merganser from the Late Pleistocene of Vero Beach, Florida, was described as Querquedula floridana (a genus now included in Anas), but upon reexamination turned out to be a species closely related to the hooded merganser; it is now named Lophodytes floridanus, but the exact relationship between this bird and the modern species is unknown. The hooded merganser was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae under the binomial name Mergus cucullatus.[2] Linnaeus based his account on the ""round-crested duck"" that had been described and illustrated by the English naturalist Mark Catesby in the first volume of his The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands that was published between 1729 and 1732.[3] Linnaeus specified the type location as America but this was restricted to Virginia and Carolina following Catesby.[4] The hooded merganser is now the only species placed in the genus Lophodytes that was introduced in 1853 by the German naturalist Ludwig Reichenbach.[5][6] The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.[6] The genus name combines the Ancient Greek lophos meaning ""crest"" with dutēs meaning ""diver"". The specific epithet cucullatus is Latin meaning ""hooded"".[7]"
090.Red_breasted_Merganser,Red breasted Merganser,"  The red-breasted merganser (Mergus serrator) is a duck species that is native to much of the Northern Hemisphere. The red breast that gives the species its common name is only displayed by males in breeding plumage. Individuals fly rapidly, and feed by diving from the surface to pursue aquatic animals underwater, using serrated bills to capture slippery fish. They migrate each year from breeding sites on lakes and rivers to their mostly coastal wintering areas, making them the only species in the genus Mergus to frequent saltwater. They form flocks outside of breeding season that are usually small but can reach 100 individuals. The worldwide population of this species is stable, though it is threatened in some areas by habitat loss and other factors. The red-breasted merganser was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae under the current binomial name Mergus serrator.[2][3] The genus name Mergus is a Latin word used by Pliny and other Roman authors to refer to an unspecified water bird. The specific epithet serrator is Latin for sawyer and is ultimately from serra, meaning saw. It refers to the saw-like projections on the bird's bill, which enable it to hold on to slippery fish, its most frequent prey.[4] The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.[5]"
091.Mockingbird,Mockingbird,"Mockingbirds are a group of New World passerine birds from the family Mimidae. They are best known for the habit of some species mimicking the songs of other birds and the sounds of insects and amphibians,[1] often loudly and in rapid succession and for being extremely territorial when raising hatchlings. Studies have shown the ability of some species to identify individual humans and treat them differently based on learned threat assessments.[2] The only mockingbird commonly found in North America is the northern mockingbird. Mockingbirds are known for singing late at night, even past midnight.[3] They are opportunistic omnivores, feeding on insects, fruits, seeds, and occasional greens.[4] The northern mockingbird is the state bird of five states in the United States, a trend that was started in 1920, when the Texas Federation of Women's Clubs proposed the idea.  In January 1927, Governor Dan Moody approved this, and Texas became the first state ever to choose a state bird. Since then, Arkansas, Florida, Mississippi, and Tennessee have also adopted the northern mockingbird as their official state bird.[5] There are about 17 species in two genera, although three species of mockingbird from the Galápagos Islands were formerly separated into a third genus, Nesomimus. The mockingbirds do not appear to form a monophyletic lineage, as Mimus and Melanotis are not each other's closest relatives; instead, Melanotis appears to be more closely related to the catbirds, while the closest living relatives of Mimus appear to be thrashers, such as the sage thrasher.[6][7] Mimus: Formerly Nesomimus (endemic to the Galapagos): Melanotis: When the survey voyage of HMS Beagle visited the Galápagos Islands in September to October 1835, the naturalist Charles Darwin noticed that the mockingbirds Mimus thenca differed from island to island, and were closely allied in appearance to mockingbirds on the South American mainland. Nearly a year later when writing up his notes on the return voyage he speculated that this,[8] together with what he had been told about Galápagos tortoises, could undermine the doctrine of stability of species. This was his first recorded expression of doubts about species being immutable, which led to his being convinced about the transmutation of species and hence evolution.[9]"
092.Nighthawk,Nighthawk," The nighthawk is a nocturnal bird  of the subfamily Chordeilinae, within the nightjar family, Caprimulgidae, which is a grouping of 92 species of medium-sized birds with long wings and short bills specialized for eating insects.[1] The nighthawk's subfamily consists of four genera: Chordeiles; Swainson, 1832, Lurocalis; Cassin, 1851, Podager; Wagler, 1832, and Nyctiprogne; Bonaparte, 1857, which are all native to the western hemisphere.[2] Species in the family Caprimulgidae exhibit similarities in plumage appearance, a fact that some attribute to convergent evolution, which occurs when species that do not share an evolutionary history develop similar adaptations, while others attribute it to parallelism which is the process by which similar adaptations arise in members of closely related species or populations.[3] Because of this, taxonomists in the past experienced difficulty in categorizing members of this group, however new advancements in molecular phylogeny have allowed for more conclusive classification.[3] Thanks to these techniques, it is now understood that there are nine genera in the family, not 16 as previously accepted, and that there are two main subfamilies: Caprimulginae (nightjars) and Chordeilinae which is the subfamily that nighthawks belong to.[3] Because of this taxonomic complexity, a lot of information regarding nightjars is conflated with information regarding nighthawks. Nighthawks are similar in most respects to the nightjars, but have shorter bills and plumage that is less soft. Nighthawks are less strictly nocturnal than many nightjars and may be seen hunting when there is still light in the sky.[3] The subfamily Chordeilinae contains four genera and ten species.[4] Under the genus Chordeiles exists the greatest number of diversity in species in the subfamily with the lesser nighthawk (Chordeiles acutipennis), the Antillean nighthawk (Chordeiles gundlachii), the common nighthawk (Chordeiles minor), the nacunda nighthawk (Chordeiles nacunda), the least nighthawk (Chordeiles pusillus), and the sand-colored nighthawk (Chordeiles rupestris) comprising the category.[4] The genus Lurocalis contains the chestnut-banded nighthawk (Lurocalis nattereri), the Rufous-bellied nighthawk (Lurocalis rufiventris), and the short-tailed nighthawk (Lurocalis semitorquatus).[4] There is only one species in the monotypic genus Nyctiprogne  which is the band-tailed nighthawk (Nyctiprogne leucopyga), a small bird differentiated from other nighthawks by its long tail and dark appearance.[4][5] While limited information is known regarding the discovery of nighthawks, it is believed that the term ""nighthawk"", first recorded in the King James Bible of 1611, was originally a local name in England for the European nightjar.[6] Its use in the Americas to refer to members of the genus Chordeiles and related genera was first recorded in 1778 when John Cassin, a renowned ornithologist responsible for the establishment of the Delaware County Institute of Science, established the classification.[6][7] Fossil records indicate that specimens later identified to be the common nighthawks (Chordeiles minor) excavated in the Southwestern US could be traced back as far as 400,000 years (during the Pleistocene era) meaning that the subfamily has been an entrenched component of new world ecology for a significant duration of time.[8] Nighthawks are medium-sized birds averaging 9 inches (22–24 cm) from bill to tail with a wingspan of about 21-22 inches (53–57 cm), short legs, and very short, wide bills that are moderately hooked at the tip.[9] The least nighthawk (Chordeiles pusillus), at 6.3 inches (15–19 cm) and 23 grams (0.81 oz), is the smallest of all Caprimulgiformes, while the Nacunda nighthawk (Chordeiles nacunda) is one of the largest nightjars in the world measuring at 11-13 inches (28–33 cm).[10][11] Nighthawks have small feet, of little use for walking, and long pointed wings. Their soft plumage is cryptically coloured to resemble bark or leaves, aiding in protection from their primary predators; foxes and racoons.[12] To promote concealment during the day, some species perch facing lengthwise along a branch, rather than across it as birds usually do. Nighthawks are generally solitary but form flocks for the purpose of migration and for elaborate mating displays.[13] These displays begin with the males diving from high in the air to produce the booming noises also associated with defense.[14] This process is followed by tail-shaking, the exposing of a white patch located on the throat of the male, and vocalizations similar to croaks.[14] Although it is unclear whether nighthawks mate for life, they are monogamous for the duration of mating season in which they develop a barren nest on the ground or another flat surface, such as an urban roof, where the female lays two patterned eggs directly onto bare ground.[15] These eggs incubate for 18 to 20 days between May and August and they emerge semi-precocial, meaning they have their eyes open and a layer of down.[14] Males will defend the nesting area, demonstrating indiscriminate aggression with displays involving diving and the production of a booming noise using their wings which deters predators and others of the same species.[15] This unselective hostility can result in a decline in the average proportion of breeding individuals in a population in densely occupied territories, even below that of the carrying capacity established by available resources.[15] This means that prey availability is not commonly cited as a concern for the conservation of nighthawks, but rather that habitat loss can be damaging to population stability.[15] Nighthawks are mostly active in the late evening and early morning or at night and feed on moths and other large flying insects by holding their beak open in flight.[16] There exists a mistaken belief that members of the Caprimulgidae family suck milk from goats (the Latin for goatsucker is Caprimulgus), however this claim is as of yet unsubstantiated.[16] Heard most often at dusk, nighthawks have been known to perform a loud, nasal call which has been described as sounding like the noise ""pee-yah"".[17] Nighthawks are visually reliant predators that feed on flying insects such as beetles (Coleoptera), sawflies, bees, ants, and wasps (Hymenoptera), flies (Diptera), caddisflies (Trichoptera), butterflies, and moths (Lepidoptera) by opening their wide mouths to allow for the entrance of the insects as they are traveling.[16] Areas of high precipitation, cool temperature, or high elevation are therefore unfavorable to nighthawks because flying insects are less mobile in such conditions.[16] Nighthawks are most often observed hunting during crepuscular periods, or during twilight, which necessitates good eyesight with insects shorter than 5mm eliciting no reaction from experimental nighthawks.[16] This consideration could pose a long-term risk to nighthawk population stability as climate change is increasing vulnerability in larger insects due to extreme weather events and higher temperatures, thus restricting prey availability for nighthawks which cannot see the, in some circumstances, 20% smaller prey organisms.[18] During the day, nighthawks roost in forested areas which provide them with cover from both predators and temperature fluctuations, although they may also occasionally be observed in grasslands and early successional habitats rich in foraging opportunities.[19] Nighthawks breed in more open habitats like beaches or clearings to allow for the males to perform their mating rituals.[14] In October 2018, the University of Alberta published research on the common nighthawk revealing that it travels 20,000 km (12,000 mi) every year during migration between the rainforests and savannas of Brazil and its breeding grounds in northern Alberta.[20] Further research has determined that, in addition to this annual migration between general regions, nighthawks demonstrate a high breeding site fidelity, thus meaning they are especially susceptible to destabilization as a result of natural disasters such as forest fires, floods or droughts, as well as anthropogenic interventions such as development.[19] Nighthawks have been observed migrating at all hours of the day in flocks of, at times, hundreds of birds which winter in both rural and urban regions of South America.[13] Nighthawk migration is considered one of the longest routes traveled for any North American bird.[13]"
093.Clark_Nutcracker,Clark's Nutcracker," Clark's nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana), sometimes referred to as Clark's crow or woodpecker crow, is a passerine bird in the family Corvidae, native to the mountains of western North America. The nutcracker is an omnivore, but subsists mainly on pine nuts, burying seeds in the ground in the summer and then retrieving them in the winter by memory.
The bird was described by the Lewis and Clark Expedition, with William Clark first observing it in 1805 along the banks of the Salmon River, a tributary of the Columbia River. Clark's nutcracker's scientific name literally means ""nutcracker of the Columbia"". In 1806 Meriwether Lewis recorded a more detailed description.[2] A skin collected by the expedition was obtained by the ornithologist Alexander Wilson, who used it to produce an  engraving for his monumental American Ornithology. Originally placed in the genus Corvus by Lewis, Clark's nutcracker was later included in Nucifraga by Wilson, which also includes two Old World species with similar lifestyles and habitats. This species is present in western North America from British Columbia and western Alberta in the north to Baja California and central New Mexico in the south. There is also a small isolated population on the peak of Cerro Potosí, elevation 3,700 metres (12,200 ft), in Nuevo León, northeast Mexico. It is mainly found in mountains at altitudes of 900–3,900 metres (3,000–12,900 ft) in conifer forest. It is not migratory except in the sense of moving back and forth locally between areas of higher and lower elevation. Outside the breeding season, it may wander extensively to lower altitudes and also further east as far as Illinois (and exceptionally, Pennsylvania), particularly following any cone crop failure in its normal areas."
094.White_breasted_Nuthatch,White breasted Nuthatch,"The white-breasted nuthatch (Sitta carolinensis) is a species of bird in the nuthatch family Sittidae. It is a medium-sized nuthatch, measuring approximately 15.5 cm (6.1 in) in length. Coloration varies somewhat along the species' range, but the upperparts are light blue-gray, with a black crown and nape in males, while females have a dark gray crown. The underparts are whitish, with a reddish tinge on the lower abdomen. Despite not being closely related, the white-breasted nuthatch and the white wagtail are very similar in plumage.[2]

The white-breasted nuthatch is a noisy bird. It has a nasal voice and often utters little cries or vocalizations, often composed of repetitions of small invariant whistles. In summer, it is an exclusively insectivorous bird, consuming a wide range of arthropods, but in winter its diet consists mainly of seeds. The nest is located in the cavity of a tree. The clutch consists of five to nine eggs, incubated for two weeks by the female, who is fed by the male. The two adults then feed the young until they fledge, and for a few weeks after that.[3]

The white-breasted nuthatch breeds throughout much of North America,[4] except in the cooler and drier areas. It is mainly found at low elevations, in deciduous forests or in mixed woodlands.[4] Seven to nine subspecies are generally distinguished by their slightly distinct distributions, vocalizations, and coloration. The species was once thought to be related to the white-cheeked nuthatch (S  leucopsis) and Przewalski's nuthatch (S. przewalskii), two species from southern Asia, but is actually more closely related to the giant nuthatch (S. magna), also from Southeast Asia."
095.Baltimore_Oriole,Baltimore Oriole," The Baltimore oriole (Icterus galbula) is a small icterid blackbird common in eastern North America as a migratory breeding bird. It received its name from the resemblance of the male's colors to those on the coat-of-arms of 17th-century Lord Baltimore.  Observations of interbreeding between the Baltimore oriole and the western Bullock's oriole Icterus bullockii, led to both being classified as a single species, called the northern oriole, from 1973 to 1995. Research by James Rising, a professor of zoology at the University of Toronto, and others showed that the two birds actually did not interbreed significantly.[2] The Baltimore oriole is the state bird of Maryland, and the namesake and mascot for the Baltimore Orioles baseball team. The Baltimore oriole was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae under the binomial name Coracias galbula.[3] He specified the type locality as America, but this was restricted to Virginia in 1931.[4][5] Linnaeus based his account on the ""Baltimore-Bird"" that had been described and illustrated by the English naturalist Mark Catesby in his The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands that was published between 1729 and 1732.[6] The Baltimore oriole is now one of 32 New World orioles placed in the genus Icterus that was introduced in 1760 by the French ornithologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.[7] Like all New World orioles, this species is named after an unrelated, physically similar family found in the Old World: the Oriolidae. The word ""Oriole"" ultimately derives from the Latin aureolus, ""golden"".[8] The genus name Icterus is from the Ancient Greek ikteros, a yellow bird, usually taken to be the Eurasian golden oriole, the sight of which was thought to cure jaundice. The specific galbula is the Latin name for a yellow bird, again usually assumed to be the golden oriole.[9]"
096.Hooded_Oriole,Hooded Oriole," The hooded oriole (Icterus cucullatus) is a medium-sized New World oriole. The male of this species ranges in color from a bright orange to a paler yellow, with a black back, face, tail and bib, with the wing containing two white bars. The female is more of an olive color with some yellow accents.[2]"
097.Orchard_Oriole,Orchard Oriole,"The orchard oriole (Icterus spurius) is the smallest species of icterid. The subspecies of the Caribbean coast of Mexico, I. s. fuertesi, is sometimes considered a separate species, the ochre oriole or Fuertes's oriole. The orchard oriole is a small bird with a length of 5.9-7.1 inches, a weight of 0.6-1.0 ounces, and a wingspan of 9.8 inches. Adult males have chestnut or ochre underparts, while adult females and juveniles have olive-green upper parts and yellowish breasts and bellies. They inhabit semi-open areas with deciduous trees in eastern North America, southern Tamaulipas, and Veracruz. Their winter range extends from central Sinaloa and southern Veracruz to northern Colombia and northwestern Venezuela. Orchard orioles prefer living near lakes and streams, nesting in tightly woven pouches attached to horizontal tree branches. They are nocturnal migrants and feed on insects, spiders, fruit, nectar, and seeds depending on the season. During flight, they usually swoop close to the ground and fly at or below treetop level. Courtship displays include bowing, seesawing, and begging. The species name ""spurius"" refers to their original misidentification as female Baltimore orioles, and they are sometimes mistaken for New World warblers."
098.Scott_Oriole,Scott's Oriole," The Scott's oriole (Icterus parisorum) is a medium-sized icterid (the same family as many blackbirds, meadowlarks, cowbirds, grackles, and others, including the New World orioles). It is primarily found in the Southwestern United States and south to Baja California Sur and central Mexico. It is very common in Sacramento and south in California. The bird is an infrequent wanderer to eastern North America, with records from NY, PA, VA, KY, TN, NC, SC, GA, and ONT. A bird in NYC's Union Square Park was seen by many in 2007. The species was first scientifically described by French ornithologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1838.  Bonaparte named the bird parisorum after the Paris brothers, powerful French financiers of the early 1700s.[2]  The English name was given by American soldier and naturalist Darius N. Couch in honor of General Winfield Scott, without knowing that the bird had previously been described by Bonaparte. There have been proposals to rename this species the yucca oriole to reflect its preferred habitat and to address the negative historical connotations associated with its current namesake’s involvement in the Trail of Tears and other episodes of ethnic cleansing in the Southeastern United States.[3]"
099.Ovenbird,Ovenbird," The ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla) is a small songbird of the New World warbler family (Parulidae). This migratory bird breeds in eastern North America and winters in Central America, many Caribbean islands, Florida and northern Venezuela.[2][3] The genus Seiurus is currently treated as monotypic, containing only the ovenbird; it is genetically distinct from all other species in the family Parulidae, probably the first genus to evolve separately from the rest of the family.[4] Before the recent genetic studies were carried out, the waterthrushes were also included in Seiurus;[3][5] these are now treated separately in the genus Parkesia as they are not very closely related to the ovenbird.[4] The species name aurocapilla is a noun phrase, so the original spelling is retained, not changed according to the gender of the genus name; Linnaeus originally named it Motacilla aurocapilla, and the ending is not changed to -us as commonly cited in the past.[6]  Etymologically aurocapilla comes from Latin and means ""golden haired"" and Seiurus is from Ancient Greek seiō, ""to shake"", and oura, ""tail"".[7]"
100.Brown_Pelican,Brown Pelican,"The brown pelican (Pelecanus occidentalis) is a bird of the pelican family, Pelecanidae, one of three species found in the Americas and one of two that feed by diving into water. It is found on the Atlantic Coast from New Jersey to the mouth of the Amazon River, and along the Pacific Coast from British Columbia to Peru, including the Galapagos Islands. The nominate subspecies in its breeding plumage has a white head with a yellowish wash on the crown. The nape and neck are dark maroon–brown. The upper sides of the neck have white lines along the base of the gular pouch, and the lower fore neck has a pale yellowish patch. The male and female are similar, but the female is slightly smaller. The nonbreeding adult has a white head and neck. The pink skin around the eyes becomes dull and gray in the nonbreeding season. It lacks any red hue, and the pouch is strongly olivaceous ochre-tinged and the legs are olivaceous gray to blackish-gray.

The brown pelican mainly feeds on fish, but occasionally eats amphibians, crustaceans, and the eggs and nestlings of birds. It nests in colonies in secluded areas, often on islands, vegetated land among sand dunes, thickets of shrubs and trees, and mangroves. Females lay two or three oval, chalky white eggs. Incubation takes 28 to 30 days with both sexes sharing duties. The newly hatched chicks are pink, turning gray or black within 4 to 14 days. About 63 days are needed for chicks to fledge. Six to 9 weeks after hatching, the juveniles leave the nest, and gather into small groups known as pods.

The brown pelican is the national bird of Saint Martin, Barbados, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and the Turks and Caicos Islands, and the official state bird of Louisiana, appearing on the flag, seal, or coat of arms of each. It has been rated as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. It was listed under the United States Endangered Species Act from 1970 to 2009, as pesticides such as dieldrin and DDT threatened its future in the Southeastern United States and California. In 1972, the use of DDT was banned in Florida, followed by the rest of the United States. Since then, the brown pelican's population has increased. In 1903, Theodore Roosevelt set aside the first National Wildlife Refuge, Florida's Pelican Island, to protect the species from hunters."
101.White_Pelican,White Pelican,"The American white pelican (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos) is a large aquatic soaring bird from the order Pelecaniformes. It breeds in interior North America, moving south and to the coasts, as far as Costa Rica, in winter."
102.Western_Wood_Pewee,Western Wood Pewee," The western wood pewee (Contopus sordidulus) is a small tyrant flycatcher. Adults are gray-olive on the upperparts[2] with light underparts, washed with olive on the breast. They have two wing bars and a dark bill with yellow at the base of the lower mandible. This bird is very similar in appearance to the eastern wood pewee; the two birds were formerly considered to be one species. The call of C. sordidulus is a loud buzzy peeer; the song consists of three rapid descending tsees ending with a descending peeer."
103.Sayornis,Sayornis,"The genus Sayornis is a small group of medium-sized insect-eating birds, known as phoebes, in the tyrant flycatcher family Tyrannidae. The genus Sayornis that was introduced by the French naturalist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1854 with black phoebe (Sayornis nigricans) as the type species.[2][3] The genus name is constructed from the specific part of Bonaparte's name for Say's phoebe, Muscicapa saya, and Ancient Greek ornis meaning ""bird"".[4] The English Phoebe is a name for the Roman moon-goddess Diana.[5]"
104.American_Pipit,American Pipit,"The American pipit (Anthus rubescens), formerly known as the buff-bellied pipit, is a small songbird native to North America. It was first described by Marmaduke Tunstall in his 1771 Ornithologia Britannica.[2] It was formerly classified as a form of the water pipit. The former subspecies, Siberian pipit, is now considered a distinct species."
105.Whip_poor_Will,Eastern Whip-poor will,"The eastern whip-poor-will (Antrostomus vociferus; also called ""whip-o-will"", ""whip o' will"", etc.) is a medium-sized (22–27 cm or 8.7–10.6 in) bird within the nightjar family, Caprimulgidae, from North America. The whip-poor-will is commonly heard within its range, but less often seen because of its camouflage. It is named onomatopoeically after its song"
106.Horned_Puffin,Horned Puffin," The horned puffin (Fratercula corniculata) is an auk found in the North Pacific Ocean, including the coasts of Alaska, Siberia and British Columbia. It is a pelagic seabird that feeds primarily by diving for fish. It nests in colonies, often with other auks. It is similar in appearance to the Atlantic puffin, its closest relative of the North Atlantic, but differs by a ""horn"" of black skin located above the eye, present in adult birds. The binomial name of this species, Fratercula corniculata, comes from the Medieval Latin fratercula, meaning “friar”; their black-and-white plumage resembling the robes of monks.[2] Corniculata means “horn-shaped” or “crescent-shaped”, in reference to the black horn above the bird's eye. The vernacular name puffin – puffed in the sense of swollen – was originally applied to the fatty, salted meat of young birds of the unrelated species, the Manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus),[3] formerly known as the ""Manks puffin"". It is an Anglo-Norman word (Middle English pophyn or poffin) used for the cured carcasses.[4] The Atlantic puffin acquired the name at a much later stage, possibly because of its similar nesting habits,[5] and it was formally applied to that species by Pennant in 1768.[3] It was later extended to include the similar and related Pacific puffins.[4] The Yup’ik of the Yukon–Kuskokwim Delta call the puffin ""qilangaq"", ""qengacuar(aq)"" (“little nose”), or ""qategarpak"" (“large white breast”).[6]  The Ainu people of Sakhalin call them etupirka, which means ""beautiful beak""."
107.Common_Raven,Common Raven,"The common raven or northern raven (Corvus corax) is a large all-black passerine bird. It is the most widely distributed of all corvids, found across the Northern Hemisphere. There are 11 accepted subspecies with little variation in appearance, although recent research has demonstrated significant genetic differences among populations from various regions. It is one of the two largest corvids, alongside the thick-billed raven, and is the heaviest passerine bird; at maturity, the common raven averages 63 centimetres (25 inches) in length and 1.47 kilograms (3.2 pounds) in weight, though up to 2 kg (4.4 lb) in the heaviest individuals. Although their typical lifespan is considerably shorter, common ravens can live more than 23 years in the wild. Young birds may travel in flocks but later mate for life, with each mated pair defending a territory.

Common ravens have coexisted with humans for thousands of years and in some areas have been so numerous that people have regarded them as pests. Part of their success as a species is due to their omnivorous diet; they are extremely versatile and opportunistic in finding sources of nutrition, feeding on carrion, insects, cereal grains, berries, fruit, small animals, nesting birds, and food waste. Some notable feats of problem-solving provide evidence that the common raven is unusually intelligent.

Over the centuries, the raven has been the subject of mythology, folklore, art, and literature. In many cultures, including the indigenous cultures of Scandinavia, ancient Ireland and Wales, Bhutan, the northwest coast of North America, and Siberia and northeast Asia, the common raven has been revered as a spiritual figure or godlike creature."
108.White_necked_Raven,White necked Raven," The white-necked raven (Corvus albicollis) is a species of raven native to eastern and southern Africa. It is somewhat smaller (50–54 cm in length) than the common raven or its nearest relative, the thick-billed raven C. crassirostris."
109.American_Redstart,American Redstart," The American redstart (Setophaga ruticilla) is a New World warbler. It is unrelated to the Old World (common) redstart. The American redstart was described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the 10th edition of his Systema Naturae under the binomial name Motacilla ruticilla.[2] The genus name Setophaga is from Ancient Greek σής :  sēs (genitive σητός : sētós) ""moth"", and φάγος : phágos ""eater"". The specific  ruticilla is  Neo-Latin  for ""redstart"" from Latin rutilus, ""red"", and the diminutive -cilla. In Ancient Greek the name was φοινίκουρος :  phoiníkouros (from φοῖνιξ :  phoĩnix- ""red"" and οὐρά : ourá ""tail"")[3] ""Redstart"" refers to the male's red tail, ""start"" being an old word for tail.[4]"
110.Geococcyx,Geococcyx,"The roadrunners (genus Geococcyx), also known as chaparral birds or chaparral cocks, are two species of fast-running ground cuckoos with long tails and crests. They are found in the southwestern and south-central United States, Mexico and Central America,[2][3] usually in the desert. Although capable of flight, roadrunners generally run away from predators. On the ground, some have been measured at 32 km/h (20 mph). The subfamily Neomorphinae, the New World ground cuckoos, includes 11 species of birds,[4] while the genus Geococcyx has just two:[5]     The roadrunner generally ranges in size from 56 to 61 cm (22 to 24 in) from tail to beak. The average weight is about 230–430 g (8–15 oz).[8] The roadrunner is a slender, black-brown and white-streaked ground bird with a distinctive head crest. It has long legs, strong feet, and an oversized dark bill. The tail is broad with white tips on the three outer tail feathers. The bird has a bare patch of skin behind each eye; this patch is shaded blue anterior to red posterior. The lesser roadrunner is slightly smaller, not as streaky, and has a smaller bill. Both the lesser roadrunner and the greater roadrunner leave behind very distinct ""X"" track marks appearing as if they are travelling in both directions.[9] Roadrunners and other members of the cuckoo family have zygodactyl feet. The roadrunner can run at speeds of up to 32 km/h (20 mph)[10] and generally prefer sprinting to flying, though it will fly to escape predators.[11] During flight, the short, rounded wings reveal a white crescent in the primary feathers. The roadrunner has a slow and descending dove-like ""coo"". It also makes a rapid, vocalized clattering sound with its beak.[12] Roadrunners inhabit the Southwestern United States, to parts of Missouri, Arkansas, and Louisiana, as well as Mexico and Central America. They live in arid lowland or mountainous shrubland or woodland. They are non-migratory, staying in their breeding area year-round.[13] The greater roadrunner is not currently considered threatened in the US, but is habitat-limited.[14] The roadrunner is an opportunistic omnivore. Its diet normally consists of insects (such as grasshoppers, crickets, caterpillars, and beetles), small reptiles (such as lizards and snakes, including rattlesnakes),[15] rodents and other small mammals, spiders (including tarantulas), scorpions, centipedes, snails, small birds (and nestlings), eggs, and fruits and seeds like those from prickly pear cactuses and sumacs. The lesser roadrunner eats mainly insects. The roadrunner forages on the ground and, when hunting, usually runs after prey from under cover. It may leap to catch insects, and commonly batters certain prey against the ground. The roadrunner is one of the few animals that preys upon rattlesnakes;[16] it is also the only real predator of tarantula hawk wasps.[13] The roadrunner usually lives alone or in pairs. Breeding pairs are monogamous and mate for life,[17] and pairs may hold a territory all year. During the courtship display, the male bows, alternately lifting and dropping his wings and spreading his tail. He parades in front of the female with his head high and his tail and wings drooped, and may bring an offering of food. The reproductive season is spring to mid-summer (depending on geographic location and species).[13] The roadrunner's nest is often composed of sticks, and may sometimes contain leaves, feathers, snakeskins, or dung.[18] It is commonly placed 1 to 3 meters (3 to 10 feet) above ground level[19] in a low tree, bush, or cactus. Roadrunner eggs are generally white. The greater roadrunner generally lays 2–6 eggs per clutch, but the lesser roadrunner's clutches are typically smaller. Hatching is asynchronous. Both sexes incubate the nest (with males incubating the nest at night) and feed the hatchlings. For the first one to two weeks after the young hatch, one parent remains at the nest. The young leave the nest at two to three weeks old, foraging with parents for a few days after.[13] During the cold desert night, the roadrunner lowers its body temperature slightly, going into a slight torpor to conserve energy. To warm itself during the day, the roadrunner exposes dark patches of skin on its back to the sun.[13] The Hopi and other Pueblo tribes believed roadrunners were medicine birds, capable of warding off evil spirits. The X-shaped footprints of roadrunners were seen as sacred symbols, believed to confuse evil spirits by concealing the bird's direction of travel. Stylized roadrunner tracks have been found in the rock art of ancestral Southwestern tribes like the Mogollon cultures. Roadrunner feathers were used to decorate Pueblo cradleboards for spiritual protection. Among Mexican Indian and American Indian tribes, such as the Pima, seeing a roadrunner is considered good luck. While some Mexican tribes revered the roadrunner and never killed it, most used its meat as a folk remedy for illness or to boost stamina and strength.[20] Central American Indigenous peoples have various beliefs about the roadrunner. The Ch’orti’, known to call it t’unk’u’x or mu’, have taboos against harming the bird.[21] The Ch'ol Maya believe roadrunners possess special powers, calling it ajkumtz’u’ due to its call, which is believed to induce tiredness in listeners.[22] The word for roadrunner in the O'odham language is taḏai, which is the name of a transit center in Tucson, Arizona.[23][24] In the O'odham tradition, the roadrunner is also credited with bringing fire to the people. The roadrunner is the state bird of New Mexico.[25] The roadrunner was made popular by the Warner Bros. cartoon characters Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner, created in 1949, and the subject of a long-running series of theatrical cartoon shorts. In each episode, the cunning, insidious, and constantly hungry Wile E. Coyote repeatedly attempts to catch and subsequently eat the Road Runner, but is never successful. The cartoons led to a misconception that the call of the roadrunner is ""meep, meep"" because the roadrunner in this cartoon series made that sound instead of the aforementioned sound of a real roadrunner. In some shorts, the Road Runner makes a noise while sticking his tongue out at Wile E. Coyote, which resembles its actual call. The cartoons rely on a misconception that a roadrunner is much faster than a coyote. In fact, a coyote's fastest sprinting speed is 64 km/h (40 mph),[26] which is twice that of a roadrunner's at 32 km/h (20 mph).[10]"
111.Loggerhead_Shrike,Loggerhead Shrike," The loggerhead shrike (Lanius ludovicianus) is a passerine bird in the family Laniidae. It is the only member of the shrike family endemic to North America; the related northern shrike (L. borealis) occurs north of its range, however it is also found in Siberia. It is nicknamed the butcherbird after its carnivorous tendencies, as it consumes prey such as insects, amphibians, lizards, small mammals and small birds, and some prey end up displayed and stored at a site, for example in a tree.[3] Due to its small size and weak talons, this predatory bird relies on impaling its prey upon thorns or barbed wire for facilitated consumption.[4] The numbers of loggerhead shrike have significantly decreased in recent years, especially in Midwestern, New England and Mid-Atlantic areas.[5] In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the loggerhead shrike in his Ornithologie based on a specimen collected in Louisiana in the United States. He used the French name La pie-griesche de la Louisiane and the Latin Lanius ludovicianus.[6] Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not usually conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature.[7] When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson.[7] One of these was the loggerhead shrike. Linnaeus included a brief description, adopted the binomial name Lanius ludovicianus (identical to Brisson's Latin name) and cited Brisson's work.[8] The specific name ludovic is Late Latin for ""Louis"" and the epithet ""-ianus"" is to describe something being of another or possessed by it. When translated, its scientific name means something alongside the lines of ""Louis’ butcher"".[9]  ""Loggerhead,"" a similar word to ""blockhead,"" refers to the unusually large head to body ratio of this bird.[10] There are seven recognized subspecies:[11] Miller, in 1931, suggested that the wing-chord-to-tail-length ratio was an important indicator for distinguishing between subspecies.[12]
Lanius ludovicianus migrans, found in eastern North America, can be distinguished from the western subspecies, L. l. excubitorides by wing length, tail length, and colour. L. l. migrans have a paler forehead than the top of the head.[13]
According to Mundy et al.’s 1997 study, there is a substantial genetic difference between the island subspecies L. l. mearnsi and the mainland subspecies L. l. gambeli due to a gene flow barrier between the two species.[14]"
112.Great_Grey_Shrike,Great Grey Shrike,"The great grey shrike (Lanius excubitor) is a large and predatory songbird species in the shrike family (Laniidae). It forms a superspecies with its parapatric southern relatives, the Iberian grey shrike (L. meridionalis), the Chinese grey shrike (L. sphenocerus) and the American loggerhead shrike (L. ludovicianus). Males and females are similar in plumage, pearly grey above with a black eye-mask and white underparts. Breeding takes place generally north of 50° northern latitude in northern Europe and Asia. Most populations migrate south in winter to temperate regions.[2] The great grey shrike is carnivorous, with rodents making up over half its diet. The species was first scientifically described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 edition of Systema Naturae under the current binomial name. His description is L[anius] cauda cuneiformi lateribus alba, dorso cano, alis nigris macula alba – ""a shrike with a wedge-shaped white-bordered tail, back grey, wings black with white spot"".[3] At that time, none of the other grey shrikes – including the lesser grey shrike (L. minor), for which the description of the tail pattern is incorrect and which some authors already recognized as distinct – were considered separate species by Linnaeus, but that was to change soon. Linnaeus' binomial name replaced the cumbersome and confusing descriptive names of the earlier naturalist books he gives as his sources: in his own Fauna Svecica he named it ampelis caerulescens, alis caudaque nigricantibus (""light-blue waxwing, wings and tail blackish""), while it is called pica cinerea sive lanius major (""ash-grey magpie or greater shrike"") by Johann Leonhard Frisch, who in his splendid colour plate confused male and female. But most authors cited by Linnaeus – Eleazar Albin, Ulisse Aldrovandi, John Ray and Francis Willughby – called it lanius cinereus major or similar, which is a near-literal equivalent of the common name ""great grey shrike"". The type locality of Linnaeus is simply given as Europa (""Europe"").[4] The scientific name of the great grey shrike literally means ""sentinel butcher"": Lanius is the Latin term for a butcher, while excubitor is Latin for a watchman or sentinel.[5] This refers to the birds' two most conspicuous behaviours – storing food animals by impaling them on thorns, and using exposed tree-tops or poles to watch the surrounding area for possible prey. Use of the former by Conrad Gessner established the quasi-scientific term lanius for the shrikes. Linnaeus chose his specific name because the species ""observes approaching hawks and announces [the presence] of songbirds""[6] as he put it. This habit was also put to use in falconry, as fancifully recorded by William Yarrell later.[7] The common English name ""shrike"" is from Old English scríc, ""shriek"", referring to the shrill call.[8] Ulisse Aldrovandi, Conrad Gessner, John Ray and Francis Willughby also reported old folk names, mainly from Germanic languages: Wereangel or Wierangel from the Pennines of England (where the bird was noted as a vagrant) as well as Warkangel, Werkengel or Wurchangel in various German dialects (e.g. around Frankfurt and Strasbourg) probably mean ""choking angel"" (cf. Standard German Würgeengel). These names are unlikely to significantly pre-date the times of Saint Boniface (c. 700 AD) because of their Christian connotation; the related Werkenvogel (""choking bird"") might, however, do so. The English version, having become wariangle or weirangle, was eventually transferred to the native red-backed shrike (L. collurio) and lingered on into modern times in Yorkshire. Along the upper Rhine, between Strasbourg and Heidelberg for example, Linkenom is attested; its origin is unclear. Low German Neghen-doer and Middle German Nünmörder were also used; this has today evolved into Neuntöter and specifically means the red-backed shrike, but could in earlier times refer to any native Lanius. It literally means ""killer of nine [prey animals]"" and refers to the food caches. A falconer's name for the great grey shrike was mattages(s)(e), which is related to mat'agasse from the western Alps. These terms may mean ""magpie killer"", due to their use for luring carnivorous birds to hunters – but perhaps more likely ""killer magpie"", considering that the bird was believed to be a peculiar sort of magpie by Johann Leonhard Frisch and others, and that another vernacular English name was ""murdering pie"". Shrike, meanwhile, is of Germanic origin also and dates back at least to Middle or Early Modern English schricum. This is related to such words as Norwegian and Swedish skrika (""shriek, skrike""), German Schrei (""scream"") or Icelandic shrikja (""shrieker""). But it seems to have become the dominant term only in rather recent times, for as late as the 18th century, the species was still widely known as ""greater butcher-bird"" in English, just like it was known as the boucher (""butcher"") in the French Jura. In Norway a vernacular name for the bird is varsler.[9] A whimsical name – presumably from Scotland or nearby England – was ""white wisky John"" in reference to its wavy and somewhat unelegant flight, during which its large areas of light plumage are conspicuous.[10] The ""grey shrike"" is also sometimes named ""gray shrike.""[11] The shrike family (Laniidae) is a member of the Corvoidea, the most ancient of the four large songbird superfamilies. Among its superfamily, the closest relatives of the Laniidae are probably the Corvidae (crows and allies). Little reliable data exists on its evolution; certainly (even though the supposed ancestral shrike ""Lanius"" miocaenus might not belong in the Laniidae, and probably does not belong in the same genus as L. excubitor) the genus dates back to Miocene times. A Lanius fossil from the Late Miocene Turolian age, c. 6 million years ago, has been found at Polgárdi, Hungary. Its relationship to the modern species is unclear. However, all things considered, the grey shrike lineage probably represents the Holarctic sister to the African radiation of fiscal shrikes. These two seem to have originated in a west- or southwestward expansion from the genus' origin, which (considering the biogeography of living Lanius lineages) was probably somewhere between Asia Minor and central Asia. At the time of the Polgárdi fossil, it is rather likely that the grey shrikes were a distinct lineage already; given that they and the fiscals generally follow Bergmann's Rule, the smallish fossil makes an unlikely ancestor to the large grey shrikes even when taking into account the somewhat warmer Miocene climate.[12] The grey shrike superspecies consists of L. excubitor and its parapatric southern relatives. As mentioned above, the other members of this group are the Iberian grey shrike (L. meridionalis), the steppe grey shrike (L. pallidirostris), the Chinese grey shrike (L. sphenocerus) and the loggerhead shrike (L. ludovicianus). The centre of this group's radiation is probably in the eastern Mediterranean region, and the southern grey shrike represents the basalmost form. The other three only diverged during the expansion into temperate regions. This must have happened fairly recently, because lineage sorting is not complete in the grey shrikes, and most of the present-day habitat of L. excubitor was uninhabitable during much of the Quaternary glaciation. Because of the phylogenetic uncertainties surrounding this close-knit group in the absence of a good fossil record, some refrain from splitting them up into distinct species; most modern authors do so however.[1][13] There are a number of subspecies:[14]"
113.Baird_Sparrow,Baird's Sparrow," Baird's sparrow (Centronyx bairdii) is a species of North American birds in the family Passerellidae of order Passeriformes. It is a migratory bird native to the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The Baird's sparrow was first described in North Dakota in 1843 by John James Audubon, and another record of this species was not made for 29 years following its discovery.[2] It was named after the American naturalist Spencer Fullerton Baird.[1]"
114.Black_throated_Sparrow,Black throated Sparrow," The black-throated sparrow (Amphispiza bilineata) is a small New World sparrow primarily found in the southwestern United States and Mexico. It is the only member of the genus Amphispiza; the five-striped sparrow, formerly also classified in Amphispiza, is now thought to be in the monotypic genus Amphispizopsis.[2] It is sometimes referred to as the desert sparrow, due to its preferred habitat of arid desert hillsides and scrub. This name usually refers to the desert sparrow of Africa and Asia."
115.Brewer_Sparrow,Brewer's Sparrow," Brewer's sparrow (Spizella breweri) is a small, slim species of American sparrow in the family Passerellidae. This bird was named after the ornithologist Thomas Mayo Brewer.[2]"
116.Chipping_Sparrow,Chipping Sparrow," The chipping sparrow (Spizella passerina) is a species of New World sparrow, a passerine bird in the family Passerellidae. It is widespread, fairly tame, and common across most of its North American range. The chipping sparrow has five subspecies.[3][4] This bird is a partial migrant with northerly populations flying southwards in the fall to overwinter in Mexico and the southern United States, and flying northward again in spring. It molts twice a year. In its breeding plumage it has orangish-rust upper parts, gray head and underparts and a distinctive reddish cap. In non-breeding plumage, the cap is brown and the facial markings are less distinct. The song is a trill and the bird has a piercing flight call that can be heard while it is migrating at night. In the winter, Chipping Sparrows are gregarious and form flocks, sometimes associating with other bird species. They mostly forage on the ground for seeds and other food items, as well as clambering on plants and trees, feeding on buds and small arthropods. In the west of their range they breed mainly in coniferous forests, but in the east, they choose woodland, farmland, parks and gardens. Breeding starts in late April and May and the nest is often built in a tree."
117.Clay_colored_Sparrow,Clay colored Sparrow," The clay-colored sparrow or clay-coloured sparrow[1] (Spizella pallida) is a small New World sparrow of North America. Adults have light brown upperparts and pale underparts, with darker streaks on the back. They have a pale crown stripe on a dark brown crown, a white line over the eyes, a dark line through the eyes, a light brown cheek patch and brown wings with wing bars. The short bill is pale with a dark tip and the back of the neck is grey; they have a long tail. Non-breeding adults and immature resemble chipping sparrows and Brewer's sparrows; they often form flocks with these birds outside the nesting season. Their breeding habitat is shrubby open areas and jack pine woods across central Canada and central northern United States east to the Great Lakes, and is expanding further eastward. The nest is an open cup on the ground or low in a shrub. These birds migrate in flocks to southern Texas and Mexico. They forage on the ground, mainly eating seeds and insects. Outside the nesting season, they often feed in small flocks. While nesting, these birds may feed far from the nest; feeding areas are not defended. The male sings from an open perch to indicate his ownership of the nesting territory. The song is a Bzzzz bzzzz za za. This bird's nests are made of grasses and lined with fine materials or hair. Three to five splotched blue-green eggs are laid and incubated for 11 days.[3] They are often parasitized by the brown-headed cowbird; the nest may be abandoned when this happens. "
118.House_Sparrow,House Sparrow,"The house sparrow (Passer domesticus) is a bird of the sparrow family Passeridae, found in most parts of the world. It is a small bird that has a typical length of 16 cm (6.3 in) and a mass of 24–39.5 g (0.85–1.39 oz). Females and young birds are coloured pale brown and grey, and males have brighter black, white, and brown markings. One of about 25 species in the genus Passer, the house sparrow is native to most of Europe, the Mediterranean Basin, and a large part of Asia. Its intentional or accidental introductions to many regions, including parts of Australasia, Africa, and the Americas, make it the most widely distributed wild bird.

The house sparrow is strongly associated with human habitation, and can live in urban or rural settings. Though found in widely varied habitats and climates, it typically avoids extensive woodlands, grasslands, polar regions, and hot, dry deserts far away from human development. For sustenance, the house sparrow routinely feeds at home and public bird feeding stations, but naturally feeds on the seeds of grains, flowering plants and weeds. However, it is an opportunistic, omnivorous eater, and commonly catches insects, their larvae, caterpillars, invertebrates and many other natural foods.

Because of its numbers, ubiquity, and association with human settlements, the house sparrow is culturally prominent. It is extensively, and usually unsuccessfully, persecuted as an agricultural pest. It has also often been kept as a pet, as well as being a food item and a symbol of lust, sexual potency, commonness, and vulgarity. Though it is widespread and abundant, its numbers have declined in some areas.[3] The animal's conservation status is listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List."
119.Field_Sparrow,Field Sparrow," The field sparrow (Spizella pusilla) is a small New World sparrow in the family Passerellidae. It is about 140 mm (6 in) long and weighs about 12.5 g (0.4 oz). The head is grey with a rust-coloured crown, white eye-ring and pink bill. The upper parts are brown streaked with black and buff, the breast is buff, the belly is white and the tail is forked. There are two different colour morphs, one being greyer and the other more rufous. The field sparrow is distributed across eastern Canada and the eastern United States, with northern populations migrating southwards to southern United States and north-eastern Mexico in the fall.[2] The typical habitat of this bird is bushy country with shrubs and grassland. The nest is a cup-shaped construction built on the ground and hidden beneath a bush or clump of grass. The birds forage on the ground or in low vegetation, feeding mainly on seeds and insects. The population is thought to be in slow decline, but it is a common species with a wide range, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of ""least concern""."
120.Fox_Sparrow,Fox Sparrow," The fox sparrow (Passerella iliaca) is a large New World sparrow. It is the only member of the genus Passerella, although some authors split the species into four (see below). More specific information regarding plumage is available in the accounts for the various taxa."
121.Grasshopper_Sparrow,Grasshopper Sparrow,"The grasshopper sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum) is a small New World sparrow. It belongs to the genus Ammodramus, which contains three species that inhabit grasslands and prairies. Grasshopper sparrows are sometimes found in crop fields and they will readily colonize reclaimed grassland. In the core of their range, grasshopper sparrows are dependent upon large areas of grassland where they avoid trees and shrubs.[2] They seek out heterogenous patches of prairie that contain clumps of dead grass or other vegetation where they conceal their nest, and also contain barer ground where they forage for insects (especially grasshoppers), spiders, and seeds.[3] Grasshopper sparrows are unusual among New World sparrows in that they sing two distinct song types, the prevalence of which varies with the nesting cycle. The primary male song, a high trill preceded by a stereotyped series of short chips, is reminiscent of the sounds of grasshoppers[4] and is the origin of this species' name. Like some other birds of the central North American grasslands, this species also moves around a lot, not only via annual migrations, but individuals frequently disperse between breeding attempts or breeding seasons. Grasshopper sparrows are in steep decline across their range, even in the core of the breeding distribution in the tallgrass prairies of the central Great Plains.[5] The Florida grasshopper sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum floridanus) is highly endangered. The grasshopper sparrow was described in 1713 by English parson and naturalist John Ray based on a specimen collected in Jamaica. It was described again and illustrated in 1725 by the naturalist and collector Hans Sloane. Both authors used the English name ""Savanna bird"".[6][7] When the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin revised and expanded Carl Linnaeus's Systema Naturae in 1789 he included the grasshopper sparrow. He placed it with the finches in the genus Fringilla, coined the binomial name Fringilla savannarum and cited the earlier authors.[8] The grasshopper sparrow is now placed with two other American sparrows in the genus Ammodramus that was introduced by William Swainson in 1827.[9] Twelve subspecies are recognised:[9]"
122.Harris_Sparrow,Harris's Sparrow," Harris's sparrow (Zonotrichia querula) is a large sparrow. Their breeding habitat is the north part of central Canada (primarily the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, ranging slightly into northern Manitoba and Saskatchewan), making it Canada's only endemic breeding bird.  In the winter they migrate to the Great Plains states of the United States, from southern South Dakota to central Texas. The common name of this species commemorates the American amateur ornithologist Edward Harris (1799–1863)."
123.Henslow_Sparrow,Henslow's Sparrow,Henslow's sparrow (Centronyx henslowii) is a passerine bird in the family Passerellidae. It was named by John James Audubon in honor of John Stevens Henslow. It was originally classified in the genus Emberiza and called Henslow's bunting.[2]
124.Le_Conte_Sparrow,Le Conte's Sparrow," LeConte's sparrow (Ammospiza leconteii), also known as LeConte's bunting,[2] is one of the smallest New World sparrow species in North America.[2]"
125.Lincoln_Sparrow,Lincoln's Sparrow," Lincoln's sparrow (Melospiza lincolnii) is a small sparrow native to North America. It is a less common passerine bird that often stays hidden under thick ground cover, but can be distinguished by its sweet, wrenlike song. Lincoln's sparrow is one of three species in the genus Melospiza which also includes the song sparrow (M. melodia) and the swamp sparrow (M. georgiana). It lives in well-covered brushy habitats, often near water. This bird is poorly documented because of its secretive nature and breeding habits solely in boreal regions.[2]"
126.Nelson_Sharp_tailed_Sparrow,Nelson's Sparrow," Nelson's sparrow (Ammospiza nelsoni) is a small New World sparrow. This bird was named after Edward William Nelson, an American naturalist. Formerly, this bird and the saltmarsh sparrow (Ammospiza caudacuta) were considered to be a single species, the sharp-tailed sparrow; because of this it was briefly known as Nelson's sharp-tailed sparrow."
127.Savannah_Sparrow,Savannah Sparrow,"The Savannah sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis) is a small New World sparrow that is the only member of the genus Passerculus. It is a widespread and abundant species that occupies open grassland habitats in North America. Over most of its range it is migratory, breeding in Canada and the northern United States while wintering in Mexico and the southern United States. It is a sexually monomorphic species that is quite variable in appearance. Around 17 subspecies are currently recognised. These are divided into several groups, some of which have sometimes been considered as separate species. The species name sandwichensis is Latin from Sandwich Sound (now Prince William Sound) in southern Alaska from where the first specimen was collected. The common name refers to Savannah, Georgia, where Alexander Wilson observed the species in 1811. The Savannah sparrow was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus's Systema Naturae. He placed it with the buntings in the genus Emberiza and coined the binomial name Emberiza sandwichensis.[2] Gmelin based his text on the Sandwich bunting that had been described by John Latham in 1783 and the ""Unalasha bunting"" that had been described by Thomas Pennant in 1785.[3][4] Latham and Pennant had access to a specimen owned by the naturalist Joseph Banks that had been collected in May 1778 from Sandwich Sound (now Prince William Sound) in southern Alaska during James Cook's third voyage to the Pacific Ocean.[5] The specimen has not survived,[6] but a coloured drawing of the bird made during the voyage by the artist and naturalist William Ellis is now held by the Natural History Museum in London.[7][8] The Savannah sparrow is now the only species placed in the genus Passerculus that was introduced in 1838 by the French naturalist Charles Bonaparte.[9][10] The English name ""Savannah sparrow"" was introduced in 1811 by the Scottish-American ornithologist Alexander Wilson in the third volume of his American Ornithology; or, the Natural History of the Birds of the United States. Wilson had first seen the species on the coast near Savannah, Georgia.[11][12] A 2005 study that compared mitochondrial DNA sequence found that the Ipswich sparrow, formerly usually considered a valid species (as Passerculus princeps), was a well-marked subspecies, whereas the southwestern large-billed sparrow was more distinct (Passerculus rostratus).[13] Seventeen subspecies (including the large-billed sparrows) are currently recognized, though many are only described from wintering birds and much of the variation seems to be clinal. Four additional subspecies are no longer generally accepted. The complex is usually divided into several groups:[10][14] All are migratory; wintering ranges overlap widely. Some post-breeding dispersal. Formerly considered as a distinct species.[13] The large-billed sparrows proper is sometimes treated as a separate species.[15] There are two dark, large and strong-billed subspecies: Belding's (Savannah/large-billed) sparrows are all-year residents of salt marshes of the Californian Pacific coast. They are dark, rufous, and have rather long but not very hefty bills. This group has been considered as a separate species.[15] San Benito (Savannah/large-billed) sparrow is a resident bird of the Islas San Benito off Baja California; a stray bird was observed on Cedros Island on April 21, 1906.[16] It has been considered as a separate species.[10]"
128.Seaside_Sparrow,Seaside Sparrow,The seaside sparrow (Ammospiza maritima) is a species of American sparrow.
129.Song_Sparrow,Song Sparrow,"The song sparrow (Melospiza melodia) is a medium-sized New World sparrow. Among the native sparrows in North America, it is easily one of the most abundant, variable and adaptable species."
130.Tree_Sparrow,American Tree Sparrow,"The American tree sparrow (Spizelloides arborea), also known as the winter sparrow,[2] is a medium-sized New World sparrow."
131.Vesper_Sparrow,Vesper Sparrow," The vesper sparrow (Pooecetes gramineus) is a medium-sized New World sparrow. The only member of the genus Pooecetes, it is a pale sparrow with brown streaks that breeds across the grasslands of northern North America. It migrates to winter in the southern United States and Mexico. The vesper sparrow was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus's Systema Naturae. He placed it with the finches in the genus Fringilla and coined the binomial name Fringilla graminea. He gave the locality as New York.[2] Gmelin based his own description on those for the ""grass finch"" that had been described by John Latham in 1783 and by Thomas Pennant in 1785.[3][4] The vesper sparrow is now the only species placed in the genus Pooecetes that was introduced in 1858 by the American naturalist Spencer Baird.[5][6] The genus name combines the Ancient Greek ποα (poa) meaning ""grass"" with οικητης (oikētēs) meaning ""dweller"". The specific epithet gramineus is Latin meaning ""grassy"" or ""grass-like"".[7] Three subspecies are recognised.[6]"
132.White_crowned_Sparrow,White crowned Sparrow," The white-crowned sparrow (Zonotrichia leucophrys) is a species of passerine bird native to North America. A medium-sized member of the New World sparrow family, this species is marked by a grey face and black and white streaking on the upper head. It breeds in brushy areas in the taiga and tundra of the northernmost parts of the continent and in the Rocky Mountains and Pacific coast. While southerly populations in the Rocky Mountains and coast are largely resident, the breeding populations of the northerly part of its range are migratory and can be found as wintering or passage visitors through most of North America south to central Mexico. The scientific name is from Ancient Greek. The genus name Zonotrichia is from Ancient Greek ζώνη (zone, transl. band) and θρίξ (thrix, transl. hair). The species name leucophrys is from λευκός (leukos, transl. white) and ὀφρῡ́ς (ophrus, transl. eyebrow).[2]"
133.White_throated_Sparrow,White throated Sparrow," The white-throated sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis) is a passerine bird of the New World sparrow family Passerellidae. It breeds in northern North America and winters in the southern United States. In 1760 the English naturalist George Edwards included an illustration and a description of the white-throated sparrow in the second volume of his Gleanings of Natural History. He used the current English name. Edwards based his hand-coloured etching on a ""neat drawing in colours"" supplied by the American naturalist William Bartram from Philadelphia in Pennsylvania.[2] When the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin revised and expanded Carl Linnaeus's Systema Naturae in 1789 he included the white-throated sparrow. He placed it with the finches in the genus Fringilla and coined the binomial name Fringilla albicollis.[3] The white-throated sparrow is now one of five American sparrows placed in the genus Zonotrichia that was introduced by William Swainson in 1832.[4] The genus name is from Ancient Greek ζωνη (zōnē)  meaning ""band"" and θριξ (thrix), τριχος (trikhos) meaning ""hair"". The specific epithet albicollis combines Latin albus meaning ""white"" with Modern Latin -collis meaning ""necked"".[5] The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.[4]"
134.Cape_Glossy_Starling,Cape Glossy Starling,"The Cape starling (Lamprotornis nitens), also known as red-shouldered glossy-starling or Cape glossy starling, is a species of starling in the family Sturnidae. It is found in Southern Africa, where it lives in woodlands, bushveld and in suburbs.[4] Two subspecies are recognised,[2] but not by all authors.[5] L. n. culminator is said to be larger, with greener wing and tail plumage. Its secondary remiges are also glossy on both vanes, i.e. not matt black on the inner vanes as in L. n. phoenicopterus.[2] In 1760, the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the Cape starling in his Ornithologie based on a specimen collected in Angola. He used the French name Le merle verd d'Angola and the Latin Merula Viridis Angolensis.[6] Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature.[7] When in 1766, the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson.[7] One of these was the Cape starling. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name Turdus nitens and cited Brisson's work.[8] The specific name nitens is Latin for ""shining"" or ""glittering"".[9] This species is now placed in the genus Lamprotornis that was introduced by the Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck in 1820.[10]"
135.Bank_Swallow,Bank Swallow,"The sand martin (Riparia riparia), also known as collared sand martin or common sand martin, and in the Americas as the bank swallow, is a migratory passerine bird in the swallow family Hirundinidae. It has a wide range in summer, embracing practically the whole Holarctic area, from Europe, across Asia to the Pacific Ocean, and throughout North America. It winters in eastern and southern Africa, southern Asia, and South America. This species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae, and originally named Hirundo riparia; the description consisted of the simple ""H[irundo] cinerea, gula abdomineque albis"" (""an ash-grey swallow, with white throat and belly"") and the type locality was simply given as ""Europa"",[3] subsequently refined to refer to Linnaeus's homeland of Sweden.[4] The specific name means ""of the riverbank""; it is derived from the Latin ripa ""riverbank"".[5] There are three or four weakly-defined subspecies:[6][7] The pale martin Riparia diluta of northern India and southeastern China was formerly sometimes included as another subspecies within sand martin.[8] It is smaller, and has paler grey-brown upperparts and a less distinct breast band. It winters in Pakistan, southern India and Sri Lanka.[9][7]"
136.Barn_Swallow,Barn Swallow,"The barn swallow (Hirundo rustica) is the most widespread species of swallow in the world, occurring on all continents, with vagrants reported even in Antarctica.[2][3] It is a distinctive passerine bird with blue upperparts and a long, deeply forked tail. In Anglophone Europe, it is just called the swallow; in northern Europe, it is the only member of family Hirundinidae called a ""swallow"" rather than a ""martin"".

There are six subspecies of barn swallow, which breed across the Northern Hemisphere.[2] Two subspecies, (H. r. savignii and H. r. transitiva) have fairly restricted ranges in the Nile valley and eastern Mediterranean, respectively.[2] The other four are more widespread, with winter ranges covering much of the Southern Hemisphere.[4]

The barn swallow is a bird of open country that normally nests in man-made structures and consequently has spread with human expansion. It builds a cup nest from mud pellets in barns or similar structures and feeds on insects caught in flight.[5] This species lives in close association with humans, and its insect-eating habits mean that it is tolerated by humans; this acceptance was reinforced in the past by superstitions regarding the bird and its nest. There are frequent cultural references to the barn swallow in literary and religious works due to both its living in close proximity to humans and its annual migration. The barn swallow is the national bird of Austria and Estonia."
137.Cliff_Swallow,Cliff Swallow,"Petrochelidon is a genus of birds known as cliff-nesting swallows. The genus name Petrochelidon is from the Greek words petra, ""rock"", and khelidon, ""swallow"".[2] The genus includes all of the five species of birds commonly called cliff swallow, and contains the following species: The genus contains ten species:[3]  This Hirundinidae-related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it."
138.Tree_Swallow,Tree Swallow,"The tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor) is a migratory bird of the family Hirundinidae. Found in the Americas, the tree swallow was first described in 1807 by French ornithologist Louis Vieillot as Hirundo bicolor. It has since been moved to its current genus, Tachycineta, within which its phylogenetic placement is debated. The tree swallow has glossy blue-green upperparts, with the exception of the blackish wings and tail, and white underparts. The bill is black, the eyes dark brown, and the legs and feet pale brown. The female is generally duller than the male, and the first-year female has mostly brown upperparts, with some blue feathers. Juveniles have brown upperparts, and gray-brown-washed breasts. The tree swallow breeds in the US and Canada. It winters along southern US coasts south, along the Gulf Coast, to Panama and the northwestern coast of South America, and in the West Indies.

The tree swallow nests either in isolated pairs or loose groups, in both natural and artificial cavities. Breeding can start as soon as early May, although this date is occurring earlier because of climate change, and it can end as late as July. This bird is generally socially monogamous (although about 8% of males are polygynous), with high levels of extra-pair paternity. This can benefit the male, but since the female controls copulation, the lack of resolution on how this behavior benefits females makes the high level of extra-pair paternity puzzling. The female incubates the clutch of two to eight (but usually four to seven) pure white eggs for around 14 to 15 days. The chicks hatch slightly asynchronously, allowing the female to prioritize which chicks to feed in times of food shortage. They generally fledge about 18 to 22 days after hatching. The tree swallow is sometimes considered a model organism, due to the large amount of research done on it.

An aerial insectivore, the tree swallow forages both alone and in groups, eating mostly insects, in addition to mollusks, spiders, and fruit. The nestlings, like the adult, primarily eat insects, fed to it by both sexes. This swallow is vulnerable to parasites, but, when on nestlings, these do little damage. The effect of disease can become stronger as a tree swallow gets older, as some parts of the immune system decline with age. Acquired T cell-mediated immunity, for example, decreases with age, whereas both innate and acquired humoral immunity do not. Because of its large range and stable population, the tree swallow is considered to be least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. In the US, it is protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, and in Canada by the Migratory Birds Convention Act. This swallow is negatively affected by human activities, such as the clearing of forests; acidified lakes can force a breeding tree swallow to go long distances to find calcium-rich food items to feed to its chicks"
139.Scarlet_Tanager,Scarlet Tanager,"The scarlet tanager (Piranga olivacea) is a medium-sized American songbird. Until recently, it was placed in the tanager family (Thraupidae), but it and other members of its genus are now classified as belonging to the cardinal family (Cardinalidae).[2] The species' plumage and vocalizations are similar to other members of the cardinal family, although the Piranga species lacks the thick conical bill (well suited to seed and insect eating) that many cardinals possess. The species resides in thick deciduous woodlands and suburbs. The genus name Piranga is from Tupi Tijepiranga, the name for an unknown small bird, and the specific olivacea is from Neo-Latin olivaceus, ""olive-green"".[3]"
140.Summer_Tanager,Summer Tanager," The summer tanager (Piranga rubra) is a medium-sized American songbird. Formerly placed in the tanager family (Thraupidae), it and other members of its genus are now classified in the cardinal family (Cardinalidae).[2] The species's plumage and vocalizations are similar to other members of the cardinal family. The summer tanager was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae under the binomial name Fringilla rubra.[3] Linnaeus based his description on the ""summer red-bird"" described and illustrated by Mark Catesby in his The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands which was published in 1729–1732.[4] Catesby gave the location as Carolina, Linnaeus specified America; the type location is now South Carolina.[5] The summer tanager is the type species of the genus Piranga that was introduced by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot in 1808.[6][7] The genus name Piranga is from Tupi Tijepiranga, the name for an unknown small bird; the specific rubra is from Latin ruber meaning ""red"".[8] Two subspecies are recognised:[7] South Padre Island, Texas Ridgway, 1869 South Padre Island, Texas (Linnaeus, 1758)"
141.Artic_Tern,Artic Tern,"The Arctic tern (Sterna paradisaea) is a tern in the family Laridae. This bird has a circumpolar breeding distribution covering the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions of Europe (as far south as Brittany), Asia, and North America (as far south as Massachusetts). The species is strongly migratory, seeing two summers each year as it migrates along a convoluted route from its northern breeding grounds to the Antarctic coast for the southern summer and back again about six months later. Recent studies have shown average annual round-trip lengths of about 70,900 km (44,100 mi) for birds nesting in Iceland and Greenland and about 48,700 km (30,300 mi) for birds nesting in the Netherlands. These are by far the longest migrations known in the animal kingdom. The Arctic tern nests once every one to three years (depending on its mating cycle).

Arctic terns are medium-sized birds. They have a length of 28–39 cm (11–15 in) and a wingspan of 65–75 cm (26–30 in).[3] They are mainly grey and white plumaged, with a red/orange beak and feet, white forehead, a black nape and crown (streaked white), and white cheeks. The grey mantle is 305 mm (12.0 in), and the scapulae are fringed brown, some tipped white. The upper wing is grey with a white leading edge, and the collar is completely white, as is the rump. The deeply forked tail is whitish, with grey outer webs.

Arctic terns are long-lived birds, with many reaching fifteen to thirty years of age. They eat mainly fish and small marine invertebrates. The species is abundant, with an estimated two million individuals. While the trend in the number of individuals in the species as a whole is not known, exploitation in the past has reduced this bird's numbers in the southern reaches of its ranges."
142.Black_Tern,Black Tern,"The black tern (Chlidonias niger) is a small tern generally found in or near inland water that breeds in Europe, Western Asia and North America. In winter the birds migrate to coastal areas of Africa and South America. The black tern was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae under the binomial name Sterna nigra.[2] Linnaeus specified the type location as Europe but it is now restricted to Uppsala in Sweden.[3] The black tern is now one of four species placed in the genus Chlidonias that was introduced in 1822 by the French naturalist Constantine Rafinesque.[4]  The genus name is from Ancient Greek khelidonios, ""swallow-like"", from khelidon, ""swallow"": another old English name  for the black tern is  ""carr (i.e. lake)  swallow"".[5] The species name is from Latin niger ""shining black"".[6] As its name suggests, it has predominantly dark plumage. In some lights it can appear blue in the breeding season, hence the old English name ""blue darr"".[7] Two subspecies are recognised. These are listed below with their breeding ranges.[4]"
143.Caspian_Tern,Caspian Tern,"The Caspian tern (Hydroprogne caspia)[2] is a species of tern, with a subcosmopolitan but scattered distribution. Despite its extensive range, it is monotypic of its genus, and has no accepted subspecies.[3] The genus name is from Ancient Greek hudros, ""water"", and Latin progne, ""swallow"". The specific caspia is from Latin and, like the English name, refers to the Caspian Sea.[4]"
144.Common_Tern,Common Tern,"The common tern[2] (Sterna hirundo) is a seabird in the family Laridae. This bird has a circumpolar distribution, its four subspecies breeding in temperate and subarctic regions of Europe, Asia and North America. It is strongly migratory, wintering in coastal tropical and subtropical regions. Breeding adults have light grey upperparts, white to very light grey underparts, a black cap, orange-red legs, and a narrow pointed bill. Depending on the subspecies, the bill may be mostly red with a black tip or all black. There are several similar species, including the partly sympatric Arctic tern, which can be separated on plumage details, leg and bill colour, or vocalisations.

Breeding in a wider range of habitats than any of its relatives, the common tern nests on any flat, poorly vegetated surface close to water, including beaches and islands, and it readily adapts to artificial substrates such as floating rafts. The nest may be a bare scrape in sand or gravel, but it is often lined or edged with whatever debris is available. Up to three eggs may be laid, their dull colours and blotchy patterns providing camouflage on the open beach. Incubation is by both sexes, and the eggs hatch in around 21–22 days, longer if the colony is disturbed by predators. The downy chicks fledge in 22–28 days. Like most terns, this species feeds by plunge-diving for fish, either in the sea or in freshwater, but molluscs, crustaceans and other invertebrate prey may form a significant part of the diet in some areas.

Eggs and young are vulnerable to predation by mammals such as rats and American mink, and large birds including gulls, owls and herons. Common terns may be infected by lice, parasitic worms, and mites, although blood parasites appear to be rare. Its large population and huge breeding range mean that this species is classed as being of least concern, although numbers in North America have declined sharply in recent decades. Despite international legislation protecting the common tern, in some areas, populations are threatened by habitat loss, pollution, or the disturbance of breeding colonies."
145.Elegant_Tern,Elegant Tern,"The elegant tern (Thalasseus elegans) is a tern in the family Laridae. It breeds on the Pacific coast of southern California in the United States and western Mexico, and migrates south to Peru, Ecuador and Chile for the northern winter; in the late summer and fall, some also disperse north to Oregon and more rarely Washington. This species breeds in very dense colonies on coasts and islands, including Isla Rasa[2] and Montague Island in Mexico,[3] and South Bay Salt Works (San Diego) and Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve in California.[4] Exceptionally, in can occur as an accidental inland on suitable large freshwater lakes.[5] The elegant tern feeds by plunge-diving for fish, almost invariably from the sea, like most Thalasseus terns. It usually dives directly, and not from the ""stepped-hover"" favored by the Arctic tern.  The offering of fish by the male to the female is part of the courtship display. This Pacific species has wandered to western Europe as a rare vagrant on a number of occasions. The first European record was at Carlingford Lough in County Down, Northern Ireland, in late June 1982.[6] It has nested in Spain,[7][6][8] and has interbred with a Sandwich tern in France.[6] There is also one record from Cape Town, South Africa, in January 2006, the first record for Africa. The current genus name is derived from Greek Thalassa, ""sea"", and elegans is  Latin  for ""elegant, fine"".[9] Though described in 1822, the genus was largely treated as a synonym of Sterna until a 2005 study demonstrated that the systematics of the terns needed review.[10] The closest relative of the elegant tern is Cabot's tern T. acuflavidus, which breeds on the Atlantic coasts of the Americas; this species pair is then next most closely related to the Old World Sandwich tern.[11][12][13] This is a medium-large tern, with a long, slender, slightly downcurved orange bill, pale gray upperparts and white underparts. It is 39–42 cm (15–17 in) long with an 76–81 cm (30–32 in) wingspan, and a weight of 190–325 g (6.7–11.5 oz).[14][15] Its legs are black. From late summer to winter, the forehead becomes white. Juvenile elegant terns have a scalier pale gray back. The call is a characteristic loud grating noise similar to other Thalasseus terns. This bird can be confused with the royal tern, but the royal tern is larger and thicker-billed and shows more white on the forehead in winter.[16] Out of range, it can also be easily confused with the lesser crested tern. See also orange-billed tern, and the external link below. This species is marginally paler above than the lesser crested tern with a white (not gray) rump, with a slightly longer, more slender bill with a different curve. The black of the crest that comes down from the crown extends through the eye, creating a small black ""smudge"" in front of the eye even in winter plumage. On royal terns, the black crest stops at the eye, while lesser crested tern has a less shaggy crest. The total population is around 90,000 pairs, with the majority on islets in the Gulf of California.[17] It nests in a ground scrape and lays one or two eggs. Unlike some of the smaller Sterna terns, it is not very aggressive toward potential predators, relying on the sheer density of the nests (often only 20–30 cm apart) and nesting close to other more aggressive species, such as Heermann's gulls, to avoid predation. However, Heermann's gulls do predate some eggs and chicks, though more significant predators are the much larger and more predatory western and yellow-footed gulls.[18] In May 2021, 1500 nests with thousands of eggs were abandoned when a drone crash landed near the nesting colony in Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve, scaring off 2,500 nesting elegant terns and leading to a catastrophic loss.[17] "
146.Forsters_Tern,Forsters Tern," Forster's tern (Sterna forsteri) is a tern in the family Laridae. The genus name Sterna is derived from Old English ""stearn"", ""tern"",[2] and forsteri commemorates the naturalist Johann Reinhold Forster.[3] It breeds inland in North America in the northern United States and southern Canada, and migrates south to winter in the southern United States, Mexico, the Caribbean, and northern Central America. It is also a rare but annual vagrant in western Europe, and has wintered in Ireland and Great Britain on a number of occasions. This species breeds in colonies in marshes. It nests in a ground scrape and lays two or more eggs. Like all white terns, it is fiercely defensive of its nest and young. The Forster's tern feeds by plunge-diving for fish, but will also hawk for insects in its breeding marshes. It usually feeds from saline environments in winter, like most Sterna terns. It usually dives directly, and not from the ""stepped-hover"" favored by the Arctic tern. The offering of fish by the male to the female is part of the courtship display. This is a medium-small tern, 33–36 cm (13–14 in) long with a 64–70 cm (25–28 in) wingspan and a weight ranging from 130 to 190 g (4.6-6.7 oz ).[4] It is most similar to the common tern, with pale gray upperparts and white underparts. Its legs are red and its bill is red, tipped with black. In winter, the forehead becomes white and a characteristic black eye mask remains. Juvenile Forster's terns are similar to the winter adult. The call is similar to that of common terns, but also some harsher sounds suggestive of a small gull like Bonaparte's gull. This species is unlikely to be confused with the common tern in winter because of the black eye mask, but is much more similar in breeding plumage. Forster's has a gray center to its white tail, and the upperwings are whiter, without the darker primary wedge of the common tern."
147.Least_Tern,Least Tern,"The least tern (Sternula antillarum) is a species of tern that breeds in North America and locally in northern South America. It is closely related to, and was formerly often considered conspecific with, the little tern of the Old World. Other close relatives include the yellow-billed tern and Peruvian tern, both from South America. It is a small tern, 22–24 cm (8.7–9.4 in) long, with a wingspan of 50 cm (20 in), and weighing 39–52 g (1.4–1.8 oz). The upper parts are a fairly uniform pale gray, and the underparts white. The head is white, with a black cap and line through the eye to the base of the bill, and a small white forehead patch above the bill; in winter, the white forehead is more extensive, with a smaller and less sharply defined black cap. The bill is yellow with a small black tip in summer, all blackish in winter. The legs are yellowish. The wings are mostly pale gray, but with conspicuous black markings on their outermost primaries. It flies over water with fast, jerky wingbeats and a distinctive hunchback appearance, with the bill pointing slightly downward. It is migratory, wintering in Central America, the Caribbean and northern South America. Many spend their whole first year in their wintering area.[2] It has occurred as a vagrant to Europe, with one record in Great Britain and one in Ireland. It differs from the little tern mainly in that its rump and tail are gray, not white, and it has a different, more squeaking call; from the yellow-billed tern in being paler gray above and having a black tip to the bill; and from the Peruvian tern in being paler gray above and white (not pale gray) below and having a shorter black tip to the bill. The differences among the three subspecies may not be as much as had been thought.[3][4] Additionally, least terns of an unknown subspecies were found in 2012 nesting on the Big Island of Hawaii.[5] The population is about 21,500 pairs; it is not currently considered federally threatened, though it is considered threatened in many of the states in which it breeds. Threats include egg and fledgling predators, high tides and recreational use of nesting beaches. The interior subspecies, with a current population of about 7000 pairs, was listed as an endangered subspecies in 1985 (estimated 1000 breeding pairs), due to loss of habitat caused by dams, reservoirs, channelization, and other changes to river systems. It was delisted on 13 January 2021.[6] The western population, the California least tern, was listed as an endangered species in 1972 with a population of about 600 pairs. With aggressive management, mainly by the exclusion of humans via fencing, the Californian population has rebounded in recent years to about 4500 pairs, a marked increase from 582 pairs in 1974 when census work began, though it is still listed as an endangered subspecies.[3][4] The California subspecies breeds on beaches and bays of the Pacific Ocean within a very limited range of southern California, in San Francisco Bay and in northwestern Mexico. While numbers have gradually increased with its protected status, it is still vulnerable to predators, natural disasters or further disturbance by humans. Recent threats include the gull-billed tern (Sterna nilotica), which can decrease reproductive success in a colony to less than 10%.[7] The least tern arrives at its breeding grounds in late April. The breeding colonies are not dense and may appear along either marine or estuarine shores, or on sandbar islands in large rivers, or in areas free from humans or predators. Courtship typically takes place removed from the nesting colony site, usually on an exposed tidal flat or beach. Only after courtship has confirmed mate selection does nesting begin by mid-May and is usually complete by mid-June. Courtship takes the form of either an aerial display in which the female follows the flight of the male or through courtship feeding.[8] Nests are situated on barren to sparsely vegetated places near water, normally on sandy or gravelly substrates. In the southeastern United States, many breeding sites are on white gravel rooftops.[9] In the San Francisco Bay region, breeding typically takes place on abandoned salt flats. Where the surface is hard, this species may use an artificial indentation (such as a deep dried footprint) to form the nest basin. The nest density may be as low as several per acre, but in San Diego County, densities of 200 nests per acre have been observed. Most commonly the clutch size is two or three, but it is not rare to consist of either one or four eggs. Adults are known to wet themselves and shake off the water over the eggs when arriving at the nest.[10] Both females and males incubate the eggs for a period of about three weeks, and both parents tend the semiprecocial young. Young birds can fly at age four weeks. After the formation of the new families, groupings of birds may appear at lacustrine settings in proximity to the coast. Late-season nesting may be renests or the result of late arrivals. In any case, the bulk of the population has left the breeding grounds by the end of August. The least tern hunts primarily in shallow estuaries and lagoons, where smaller fishes are abundant. It hovers until spotting prey, and then plunges into the water without full submersion to extract meal. The most common prey recently for both chicks and adults are silversides smelt (Atherinops spp.) and anchovy (Anchoa spp.) in southern California,[11] as well as shiner perch, and small crustaceans elsewhere. Adults in southern California eat kelpfish (most likely giant kelpfish, Heterostichus rostratus).[11] Insects are known to be eaten during El Niño events.[12][13] In southern California, least terns feed in bays and lagoons, near shore, and more than 24 km (15 mi) from shore in the open ocean.[11] Elsewhere, they feed in proximity to lagoons or bay mouths. Adults do not require cover, so that they commonly roost and nest on the open ground. After young chicks are three days old, they are brooded less frequently by parents and require wind blocks and shade, and protection from predators. In some colonies in southern California, Spanish roof tiles are placed in colonies so chicks can hide there. Notable disruption of colonies can occur from predation by burrowing owls, gull-billed terns and American kestrels.[14] Depredation by domestic cats has been observed in at least one colony.[15] Predation on inland breeding terns by coyotes, bobcats, feral dogs and cats, great blue herons, Mississippi kites, and owls has also been documented.[3][4][16]"
148.Green_tailed_Towhee,Green tailed Towhee," The green-tailed towhee (Pipilo chlorurus) is the smallest towhee, but is still one of the larger members of the American sparrow family Passerellidae. Its breeding range covers most of the interior Western United States, with a winter range in Mexico and the southern edge of the Southwestern United States. This bird can be recognized by the bright green stripes on the edge of its wings. It has a distinct white throat and a rufous cap. It measures 7.25 in (18.4 cm) long and weighs 29 g (1.0 oz).[2] It is fairly tame, but often stays hidden under a bush. It is fairly common in habitats with sagebrush and other such bushes. It is uncommonly seen because of its tendency to stay under cover."
149.Brown_Thrasher,Brown Thrasher,"The brown thrasher (Toxostoma rufum), sometimes erroneously called the brown thrush or fox-coloured thrush, is a bird in the family Mimidae, which also includes the New World catbirds and mockingbirds. The brown thrasher is abundant throughout the eastern and central United States and southern and central Canada, and it is the only thrasher to live primarily east of the Rockies and central Texas. It is the state bird of Georgia.

As a member of the genus Toxostoma, the bird is relatively large-sized among the other thrashers. It has brown upper parts with a white under part with dark streaks. Because of this, it is often confused with the smaller wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), among other species. The brown thrasher is noted for having over 1000 song types, and the largest song repertoire of birds.[3] However, each note is usually repeated in two or three phrases.

The brown thrasher is an omnivore, with its diet ranging from insects to fruits and nuts. The usual nesting areas are shrubs, small trees, or at times on ground level. Brown thrashers are generally inconspicuous but territorial birds, especially when defending their nests, and will attack species as large as humans.[4]"
150.Sage_Thrasher,Sage Thrasher," The sage thrasher (Oreoscoptes montanus) is a medium-sized passerine bird from the family Mimidae, which also includes mockingbirds, tremblers, and New World catbirds. It is the only member of the genus Oreoscoptes. This seems less close to the Caribbean thrashers, but rather to the mockingbirds instead (Hunt et al. 2001, Barber et al. 2004)."
151.Black_capped_Vireo,Black capped Vireo,"The black-capped vireo (Vireo atricapilla) is a small bird native to the United States and Mexico. It was listed as an endangered species in the United States in 1987. It is the only Vireo that is sexually dichromatic.[3] Recovery of the species' population contributed to its delisting in 2018.[4][5]: 16236   The IUCN lists the species as ""near threatened.""[1]"
152.Blue_headed_Vireo,Blue headed Vireo," The blue-headed vireo (Vireo solitarius) is a migrating song bird found in North and Central America. There are currently two recognized subspecies that belong to the blue-headed vireo. It has a range that extends across Canada and the eastern coast of the United-States, Mexico and some of Central America. It prefers large temperate forests with a mix of evergreen trees and deciduous under growth. As the name suggests, the blue-headed vireo is characterized by its blue-grey head and bold yellow wing bars. Both sexes are very similar in plumage and size. Juveniles also have a similar plumage. Populations of the blue-headed vireo have been steadily increasing since the 1970s. Therefore, in 2004, the species was classified as a ""Least Concern"" species.[2]"
153.Philadelphia_Vireo,Philadelphia Vireo," The Philadelphia vireo (Vireo philadelphicus) is a small North American songbird in the vireo family (Vireonidae). ""Vireo"" is a Latin word referring to a green migratory bird, perhaps the female golden oriole, possibly the European greenfinch. The specific philadelphicus is for the city of Philadelphia.[2][3]"
154.Red_eyed_Vireo,Red eyed Vireo," The red-eyed vireo (Vireo olivaceus) is a small American songbird. It is somewhat warbler-like but not closely related to the New World warblers (Parulidae). Common across its vast range, this species is not considered threatened by the IUCN. ""Vireo"" is a Latin word referring to a green migratory bird, perhaps the female golden oriole, possibly the European greenfinch. The specific olivaceus is Neo-Latin for olive-green, from Latin oliva ""olive"".[2][3]"
155.Warbling_Vireo,Warbling Vireo," The warbling vireo (Vireo gilvus) is a small North American songbird. Its breeding habitat is open deciduous and mixed woods from Alaska to Mexico. It often nests in widely spaced trees, often cottonwood or aspen, along streams or rivers. It migrates to Mexico and Central America. Measurements:[2] They are mainly olive-grey on the head and upperparts with white underparts; they have brown eyes and the front of the face is light. There is a white supercilium. They have thick blue-grey legs and a stout bill. Western birds are generally smaller and have darker grey crowns. Warbling vireos forage for insects in trees, hopping along branches and sometimes hovering. They also eat berries, especially before migration and in winter quarters, where they are – like other vireos – apparently quite fond of gumbo-limbo seeds, though they will not venture into human-modified habitat to get them.[3]
They make a deep cup nest suspended from a tree branch or shrub, placed relatively high in the east and lower in the west. The male helps with incubation and may sing from the nest. The warbling vireo's song is a cheerful warble, similar to that of the painted bunting and the purple finch. There are subtle differences in song between eastern and western birds, at least where the ranges meet in Alberta. Some authorities split the eastern and western races of this species into separate species:
The western warbling vireo, V. swainsoni, includes V. g. swainsoni, which breeds from southeastern Alaska and southwestern Northwest Territories to the Sierra San Pedro Mártir, Baja California, and V. g. brewsteri, which breeds from southern Idaho, Wyoming, and Montana to south-central Oaxaca. These two subspecies winter in Mexico. The swainsoni group also includes V. g. victoriae, an isolated population breeding in the Sierra de la Laguna, Baja California Sur, and migrating to unknown wintering grounds.[4] The eastern warbling vireo, V. g. gilvus, breeds from central Alberta and northern Montana east and south through most of the United States and parts of southern Canada, outside the range of the previous group. It winters south of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec from south-central Chiapas to Nicaragua. It completes its autumn molt on the breeding grounds, while the swainsonii group completes it after leaving.[4] The brown-capped vireo (Vireo leucophrys), resident in Central America and northern South America, is sometimes considered conspecific with the warbling vireo. "
156.White_eyed_Vireo,White eyed Vireo," The white-eyed vireo (Vireo griseus) is a small songbird of the family Vireonidae. It breeds in the eastern United States from New England west to northern Missouri and south to Texas and Florida, and also in eastern Mexico, northern Central America, Cuba and the Bahamas. Populations on the US Gulf Coast and further south are resident, but most North American birds migrate south in winter. This vireo frequents bushes and shrubs in abandoned cultivation or overgrown pastures. They nest near the ground in tangled thickets, they are made of weeds, leaves, grass, bark or any trash.[2] The grass-lined nest is a neat cup shape, attached to a fork in a tree branch by spider webs. It lays 3–5 dark-spotted white eggs. Both the male and female incubate the eggs for 12–16 days. The young leave the nest 9–11 days after hatching."
157.Yellow_throated_Vireo,Yellow throated Vireo," The yellow-throated vireo (Vireo flavifrons) is a small American songbird. ""Vireo"" is a Latin word referring to a green migratory bird, perhaps the female golden oriole, possibly the European greenfinch. The specific flavifrons is from the Latin words flavus, ""yellow"", and frons, ""forehead"".[2][3]"
158.Bay_breasted_Warbler,Bay breasted Warbler,"The bay-breasted warbler (Setophaga castanea) is a small species of songbird in the New World warbler family, Parulidae. It is one of thirty-four species in the diverse genus Setophaga.[2] Like all songbirds, or passerines, the species is classified in the order Passeriformes. Bay-breasted warblers breed in the boreal spruce-fir forests of eastern and central Canada, as well as the extreme northern United States.[3] The species winters in the wet lowland forests of northeastern South America, the Caribbean, and southern Central America, and may be seen during spring and fall migration across the eastern half of the United States in a variety of vegetative communities. Many individuals cross the Gulf of Mexico on their long-distance migration, although some travel north and south along the Mexican shore.[4] In the breeding season, bay-breasted warblers feed primarily on insects and spiders, especially the spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana).[5] These are gleaned from vegetation, never caught on the wing. To avoid competition with similar species, bay-breasted warblers concentrate their foraging on the breeding grounds to the interior middle portions of coniferous trees.[6] On wintering grounds in the tropics, fruit forms a majority of the diet. Wintering bay-breasted warblers often form mixed-species flocks with other neotropical migrants and resident species. These flocks seek food in the forest canopy, and the bay-breasted warbler is often an aggressive member of the unit, bullying smaller species from potential food sources.[4] Nests are typically constructed in the lower portion of a spruce or fir tree. The nest is cup-shaped and primarily composed of plant material, with spider silk often utilized as well. Average clutch size is 4–7 whitish eggs with dark spots. The young are altricial at birth, with limited down.[4]"
159.Black_and_white_Warbler,Black and white Warbler,"The black-and-white warbler (Mniotilta varia) is a species of New World warbler, and the only member of its genus, Mniotilta.[2] 
It breeds in northern and eastern North America and winters in Florida, Central America, and the West Indies down to Peru. This species is a very rare vagrant to western Europe.[2] Relative to other New World warblers, it is not well studied.[3]"
160.Black_throated_Blue_Warbler,Black throated Blue Warbler,"The black-throated blue warbler (Setophaga caerulescens) is a small passerine bird of the New World warbler family. Its breeding ranges are located in the interior of deciduous and mixed coniferous forests in eastern North America. Over the cooler months, it migrates to islands in the Caribbean and Central America. It is very rarely found in western Europe, where it is considered to be a non-indigenous species. The black-throated blue warbler is sexually dimorphic; the adult male has a black face and cheeks, deep blue upperparts and white underparts, while the adult female is olive-brown above and light yellow below.

Predominantly insectivorous, the black-throated blue warbler supplements its diet with berries and seeds in winter. It builds its nests in thick shrubs and the closeness of its nesting sites to the ground make it a favored species for the study of warbler behavior in the wild. The black-throated blue warbler defends its territory against other birds of the same species for both nesting and winter habitats. As the black-throated blue warbler requires large, unbroken forest areas for nesting, its numbers are declining."
161.Blue_winged_Warbler,Blue winged Warbler," The blue-winged warbler (Vermivora cyanoptera) is a fairly common New World warbler, 11.5 cm (4.5 in) long and weighing 8.5 g (0.30 oz). It breeds in eastern North America in southern Ontario and the eastern United States. Its range is extending northwards, where it is replacing the very closely related golden-winged warbler (Vermivora chrysoptera). The common name blue-winged warbler refers to the bluish-gray color of the wings that contrast with the bright yellow body of the male. The name of the genus Vermivora means ""worm-eating"". The genus used to include nine other new world warblers but now only includes this species, the golden-winged warbler and Bachman's warbler (Vermivora bachmanii), which is believed to be extinct. The blue-winged warbler was one of the many species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his 18th-century work, Systema Naturae, though the scientific name has changed several times.[2] The species epithet Pinus was given by Linnaeus in 1766 but was a mistake as the original description of the species was actually based on illustrations of ""pine creepers"" drawn by others. The drawings depicted two different species, what we now call a pine warbler and blue-winged warbler. In 2010 the blue-winged warbler's scientific name was changed by the American Ornithologists' Union to correct the error. Pine warblers retained the species name Pinus but the species epithet for blue-winged warbler was changed to cyanoptera.[3] The blue-winged and golden-winged warblers are often compared to one another. Originally, the blue-winged warbler evolved on the interior of the continent, while the golden-winged species bred closer to the Atlantic coast.[4] However, in the recent years, their habitats have drastically changed due to urbanization, deforestation, and other factors. Golden-winged warblers are generally more susceptible to displacement from the blue-winged warblers. One example of this can be seen in the warbler population in central New York state. In the 1980s, the blue-winged warbler significantly increased in the area while the golden-winged warbler's population decline.[5] Because of the trend, it is often assumed that the blue-winged warbler somehow causes the local extinction of the golden-winged warbler; however, molecular studies confirm that the blue-winged warbler and golden-winged warbler are sister species that diverged sometime around 1.5 million years ago.[6] Studies reveal that the two species are genetically 99.97% alike,[7] and that their main differences are their general phenotypic appearances and singing tones. New studies also explain that the two warblers can coexist in their chosen habitat.[8] The two species can also hybridize freely where their habitats overlap, producing two hybrid types: Lawrence's warbler and Brewster's warbler. This species forms two distinctive hybrids with the golden-winged warbler where their ranges overlap in the Great Lakes and New England area. The more common and genetically dominant Brewster's warbler is gray above and whitish (male) or yellow (female) below. It has a black eye stripe and two white wing bars. The rarer recessive Lawrence's warbler has a male plumage which is green and yellow above and yellow below, with white wing bars and the same face pattern as male golden-winged. The female is gray above and whitish below with two yellow wing bars and the same face pattern as female golden-winged."
162.Canada_Warbler,Canada Warbler," The Canada warbler (Cardellina canadensis) is a small boreal songbird of the New World warbler family (Parulidae). It summers in Canada and northeastern United States and winters in northern South America. In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the Canada warbler in his Ornithologie based on a specimen collected in Canada. He used the French name Le gobe-mouche cendré de Canada and the Latin name Muscicapa Canadensis Cinerea.[2] Although Brissn coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature.[3] When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson.[3] One of these was the Canada warbler. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name Muscicapa canadensis, and cited Brisson's work.[4] The species is now placed in the genus Cardellina that was introduced by the French naturalist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1850.[5] The species is monotypic.[6]"
163.Cape_May_Warbler,Cape May Warbler,"The Cape May warbler (Setophaga tigrina) is a species of New World warbler. It breeds in northern North America. Its breeding range spans all but the westernmost parts of southern Canada, the Great Lakes region, and New England. It is migratory, wintering in the West Indies. This species is a very rare vagrant to western Europe, with two records in Britain as of October 2013. The English name refers to Cape May, New Jersey, where George Ord collected the specimen later described by Alexander Wilson. This species was not recorded again in Cape May for another 100 years, although it is now known as an uncommon migrant there.[2] The genus name Setophaga is from Ancient Greek ses, ""moth,"" and phagos, ""eating"", and the specific  tigrina is Latin for ""tiger-striped"" from tigris, ""tiger"".[3]"
164.Cerulean_Warbler,Cerulean Warbler,"The cerulean warbler (Setophaga cerulea) is a small songbird in the family Parulidae. It is a long-distance migrant, breeding in eastern North American hardwood forests. In the non-breeding season, it winters on the eastern slope of the Andes in South America, preferring subtropical forests.

It displays strong sexual dichromatism: Adult males have cerulean blue and white upperparts, with a black necklace across the breast and black streaks on the back and flanks. Females and immature birds have bluish-green upperparts, a pale stripe over the eye, no streaking, and are yellow below. All have two white wing bars and a thin, pointed bill.

The cerulean warbler is insectivorous and predominantly feeds on insect larvae, though it also takes winged insects. It forages for prey and nests high in forest canopies. Individuals are strongly territorial; males will defend areas of forests. Males arrive on breeding grounds about one to two weeks earlier than females. Breeding and incubation take place from late May to early June.

The species is rated as near threatened on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)'s Red List of endangered species, indicating it is under risk of becoming vulnerable in the near future. The population of the cerulean warbler has been under rapid decline, though in recent years this decline has slowed. Deforestation in its non-breeding range continues to reduce its available habitat."
165.Chestnut_sided_Warbler,Chestnut sided Warbler," The chestnut-sided warbler (Setophaga pensylvanica) is a New World warbler. They breed in eastern North America and in southern Canada westwards to the Canadian Prairies. They also breed in the Great Lakes region and in the eastern United States. The genus name Setophaga is from Ancient Greek ses, ""moth"", and phagos, ""eating"", and the specific  pennsylvanicus means ""Pennsylvania"".[2] Setophaga icterocephala is a junior synonym of S. pennsylvanicus, and is no longer used.[3] The chestnut-sided warbler used to be in the genus Dendroica; however, it was merged with the genus Setophaga in 2011.[4] The change resulted with Setophaga having the most species in the family of New World warblers.[3] No subspecies have been described."
166.Golden_winged_Warbler,Golden winged Warbler," The golden-winged warbler (Vermivora chrysoptera) is a New World warbler. It breeds in southeastern and south-central Canada and in the Appalachian Mountains in northeastern to north-central United States. The majority (~70%) of the global population breeds in Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Manitoba. Golden-winged warbler populations are slowly expanding northwards, but are generally declining across its range, most likely as a result of habitat loss and competition/interbreeding with the very closely related blue-winged warbler, Vermivora cyanoptera. Populations are now restricted to two regions: the Great Lakes and the Appalachian Mountains. The Appalachian population has declined 98% since the 1960s and is significantly imperiled.[2] The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has been petitioned to list the species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 and is currently reviewing all information after issuing a positive finding.[3] Upon review, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service found that the petition to list the species as endangered or threatened presents ""substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that listing the golden-winged warbler may be warranted.""[4] The genus name Vermivora is from Latin vermis ""worm"", and vorare, ""to devour"", and the specific  chrysoptera is from Ancient Greek khrusos, ""gold"", and pteron, ""wing"".[5]"
167.Hooded_Warbler,Hooded Warbler,"The hooded warbler (Setophaga citrina) is a New World warbler. It breeds in eastern North America across the eastern United States and into southernmost Canada (Ontario). It is migratory, wintering in Central America and the West Indies. Hooded warblers are very rare vagrants to western Europe. Recent genetic research has suggested that the type species of Wilsonia (hooded warbler W. citrina) and of Setophaga (American redstart S. ruticilla) are closely related and should be merged into the same genus. As the name Setophaga (published in 1827) takes priority over Wilsonia (published in 1838), hooded warbler would then be transferred as Setophaga citrina.[2] This change has been accepted by the North American Classification Committee of the American Ornithologists' Union,[3] and the IOC World Bird List.[4] The South American Classification Committee continues to list the bird in the genus Wilsonia. The French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon described the hooded warbler in 1779 in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux from a specimen collected in Louisiana.[5] The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by François-Nicolas Martinet in the Planches Enluminées D'Histoire Naturelle which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text.[6]  Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name Muscicapa citrina in his catalogue of the Planches Enluminées.[7] The hooded warbler was formerly placed in the genus Wilsonia.[8] A molecular phylogenetic study of the family Parulidae published in 2010 found that the hooded warbler was embedded in a clade that contained species then assigned to Dendroica as well as two of four species of Parula and the monotypic genera Catharopeza and Setophaga.[9] To create a monophyletic genus, all members of the clade were placed in the expanded genus Setophaga, which under the rules of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, had priority.[9][10] The genus Setophaga was introduced by the English naturalist William Swainson in 1827.[11]
The species is monotypic; no subspecies are recognised.[10] The genus name Setophaga is from Ancient Greek ses, ""moth"", and phagos, ""eating"", and the specific  citrina is Latin for citrine.[12]"
168.Kentucky_Warbler,Kentucky Warbler,"The Kentucky warbler (Geothlypis formosa) is a small species of New World warbler. It is a sluggish and heavy warbler with a short tail, preferring to spend most of its time on or near the ground, except when singing."
169.Magnolia_Warbler,Magnolia Warbler,"The magnolia warbler (Setophaga magnolia) is a member of the wood warbler family Parulidae. The genus name Setophaga is from Ancient Greek ses, ""moth"", and phagos, ""eating"", and the specific  magnolia refers to the type locality. American ornithologist Alexander Wilson found this species in magnolias near Fort Adams, Mississippi.[2]"
170.Mourning_Warbler,Mourning Warbler,"The mourning warbler (Geothlypis philadelphia) is a small songbird of the New World warbler family. Mourning warblers are native to eastern and central North America as well as some countries in Central America.[2] They are neotropical migrants and tend to be found in dense second growth forests.[3] They are under the Wood-warbler category, which consists of arboreal and terrestrial colorful passerines. Wood warblers are in the order Passeriformes, which are perching birds including more than half of all bird species, and the family Parulidae which also includes the Common Yellowthroat, Black and White Warbler, Nashville Warbler, ovenbird, and American Redstart. They are very similar to the MacGillivray's Warbler in appearance, especially in females and immature birds, but their breeding range does not overlap into the west.[4] The ""mourning"" in this bird's name refers to the male's hood, thought to resemble a mourning veil. Mourning warblers are small songbird with yellow underparts, olive-green upperparts, a thin pointed bill and pink legs. Adult males have a gray hood, black lores and a black patch on the throat and breast. In the fall, this pattern becomes less bright and harder to distinguish from similar species; however they never have a broken eye ring.[5] Females and immatures are gray-brown on the head with an incomplete eye-ring. They have a yellow-gray throat with a brown or olive tint to their breast. Both sexes can range from 10 to 15 cm (3.9-5.9 in) in length and 11–13 g (0.4–0.5 oz) in weight. Their wingspan is 18 cm (7.1 in).[5][3] Other than the MacGillivray's Warbler, similar species include the Connecticut warblers which have a complete eye ring, not to be confused with a broken eye ring seen on immature Mourning warblers. Immature Connecticut warblers also have a whiter chest compared to the yellow chest on immature Mourning warblers. Nashville warblers are also commonly confused; however they have a yellow throat unlike the black or grey throats of Mourning warblers, females have a grey back, and they are smaller and less active than Mourning warblers.[5] During the breeding season, Mourning warblers prefer second growth clearings. This habitat is made up of thickets, semi-open areas with dense shrubs, dead fallen trees and covered canopies. Second growth clearings are caused by human activities such as mining, logging, and agriculture. [5]They can also be caused by natural occurrences such as storms, natural fires or insect outbreaks. In the Appalachians and northernmost parts of their range, they are known to seek out habitat at higher elevations. [3]The clearings are usually occupied after 1-2 years of regeneration, though some Mourning warblers have been captured in areas 3-6 years after logging.[5]After 7 years or so, the habitat becomes too overgrown for breeding Mourning warblers. [3] Even though they often occupy similar habitat to their breeding habitat in the, they winter are not necessarily related. [3]They have been known to occupy scrublands, dry woods, coasts and urban areas outside of their breeding season which contrasts with their breeding season preferences. [5] While breeding, they can be found in Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, southwest Northwest Territories and northeastern British Columbia. Their southernmost breeding grounds include North Dakota, Minnesota, Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, New York (state), Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Virginia. [5]Breeding populations overlap with several other warbler species including the Kentucky warbler, Chestnut-sided warbler, and Connecticut warbler. [6]Winter ranges vary between latin and southern American countries. They are common in Ecuador, Venezuela and Colombia, but have also been found in Nicaragua, Costa Rica, El Salvador, and the Dominican Republic.[6][5] Local distribution changes frequently, given their preference for disturbed forests. Means of which forests become altered such as logging or agriculture move frequently, in turn Mourning warbler populations follow. [6] Mourning warblers forage for food low in vegetation, along tree branches, and catch insects in flight. Mourning warblers diet mainly consist of insects, spiders, beetles, caterpillars and larvae, but also some plant material including fruiting bodies from the Cecropia tree during the winter. They eat more fruits during their migration. [3] Mourning warblers are also known to remove the legs and wings of the insects before consuming. [5] Mourning warblers' nests are open cupped and placed low to or on the ground in a well-concealed location under thick shrubs, other vegetation or canopies which they use as shelter. Their nest is usually made out of grass, leaves and bark and lined with roots or other thin material.[7]Nests are around 6.3 inches across and 3.4 inches tall. [3] Mourning warblers typically lay 2–5 eggs, which are white or speckled brown and black in appearance. Incubation is 12 days long and both adult males and females are responsible. [8] Mourning warblers have young with gray tufts on their head and red mouths. Adult females are also known consume their eggs after their young hatch. The number of days for young to fledge is 7–9.[9] Mourning warblers begin to migrate south for the winter from northern United States and Canada in late August but sometimes leave as late as November. They arrive in central America in September through October. [5][10]They begin their migration back north in March, but sometimes in May. When returning north, Mourning warblers generally follow the coast of central America. They follow the Mississippi River and Ohio River valleys before they disperse to the east and west. Mourning warblers that breed in the east follow the Appalachian Mountain ranges and east coast. They reach their breeding grounds by May and June, and repeat the process. [5][10] Male to female rations indicate climate change may be affecting breeding and migration. Studies show that during seasons with a higher median temperature, more females arrived to breeding grounds than males. Although the has not affected protandry yet, Mourning warblers' behavior has changed in response to the warming climate. [11] The song of this bird is a bright repetitive warble. The warble consists of rolling phrases that sound that typically lower in volume at the end and can sound like ""chirry, chirry, chirry, chorry, chorry."" The call is a sharp chip. There are usually two different pitched calls, with one higher than the harsh chip.[12]Male Mourning warblers use calls to establish their territory and scare away other males. [13] Mourning Warblers' calls vary between regions, known as regiolects. Regiolects are defined as differences in syllables. There are several regiolects found across the Mourning warbler's range: A Newfoundland regiolect, a Nova Scotia regiolect, and an eastern and western regiolect. [14]The eastern regiolect is found in Quebec and eastern United States. The western regiolect is found in Minnesota, western Ontario and Alberta. Some possible explanations are the island effect, geographical separations such as large bodies of water, and human development. [14] According to the North American Breeding Bird Survey, Mourning Warbler populations have declined by about 43% in the last 50 years.[15] However, they are still categorized as a species of least concern with 14 million estimated as a global breeding population by Partners in Flight. [3] Partners in flight generates conservation plans such as prescribed burnings and other active disturbances to create habitat for the Mourning warbler. Hiking trails in Ontario haveset a precedent in conservation for Mourning warblers. Breeding Mourning warblers are most common in parts of the forest without hiking trails. This led to the placement of trails with mourning warblers and other ground nesting birds in mind, as to not disturb them and other ground nesting species.[5] Numbers show that Mourning warblers are frequently killed by buildings. Mourning warblers are 19.3 times more likely to crash into low-rise buildings than other bird species. Similar to other wildlife species, it is common for the Mourning Warbler to be killed by motor vehicles as well. [5]Herbicides are also a danger to Mourning warblers. While the effect is small, there are herbicides that disturb Mourning warblers more than others. [3]  }"
171.Myrtle_Warbler,Myrtle Warbler," The myrtle warbler (Setophaga coronata) is a small New World warbler. It is considered a subspecies of the yellow-rumped warbler and its own species by different classification societies. The myrtle warbler has a northerly and easterly distribution, with the Audubon's warbler farther west. It breeds in much of Canada and the northeastern United States. It is migratory, wintering in the southeastern United States, eastern Central America, and the Caribbean. It is a rare vagrant to western Europe, and has wintered in Great Britain. The summer male myrtle warbler has a slate blue back, and yellow crown, rump and flank patch. It has white tail patches, and the breast is streaked black. The female has a similar pattern, but the back is brown as are the breast streaks. The myrtle can be distinguished from the similar Audubon's warbler by its whitish eyestripe, white (not yellow) throat, and contrasting cheek patch.  Their trill-like songs, nearly indistinguishable, consist of a three or four syllable ""tyew-tyew-tyew-tyew"", sometimes followed by three more ""tew""s. The call is a hard check. Its breeding habitat is a variety of coniferous and mixed woodland. Myrtle warblers nest in a tree, laying four or five eggs in a cup nest. These birds are insectivorous, but will readily take wax-myrtle berries in winter, a habit which gives the species its name. Experienced birders recognize myrtle warblers with the naked eye by their flycatcher-like habit of making short flights from their perch in search of bugs. They form small flocks on migration or in winter. This passerine bird was long known to be closely related to its counterparts Audubon's warbler and Goldman's warbler, and at various times the three forms have been classed as either one, two or three species. At present, the American Ornithological Society and Clements considers the myrtle, Audubon's, and Goldman's warbler three subspecies of the yellow-rumped warbler (Setophaga coronata coronata, Setophaga coronata auduboni, and Setophaga coronata goldmani respectively) while the IOC World Bird List classifies the myrtle warbler, Audubon's, and Goldman's warbler as separate species (Setophaga coronata, Setophaga auduboni, and Setophaga goldmani)."
172.Nashville_Warbler,Nashville Warbler,"The Nashville warbler (Leiothlypis ruficapilla) is a small songbird in the New World warbler family, found in North and Central America. It breeds in parts of the northern and western United States and southern Canada, and migrates to winter in southern California and Texas, Mexico, and the north of Central America. It has a gray head and a green back, and its underparts are yellow and white."
173.Orange_crowned_Warbler,Orange crowned Warbler,"The orange-crowned warbler (Leiothlypis celata) is a small songbird of the New World warbler family. The orange-crowned warbler was formally described in 1822 by the American zoologist Thomas Say under the binomial name Sylvia celatus from a specimen collected on an expedition from Pittsburgh to the Rocky Mountains led by Stephen Harriman Long.[2] The specific epithet celatus is Latin and means ""secret"" or ""hidden"".[3] The type locality is Omaha, Nebraska.[4] The orange-crowned warbler is now placed in the genus Leiothlypis that was introduced by the Dutch ornithologist George Sangster in 2008. The genus name is derived from the Ancient Greek λειος/leios meaning ""plain"" and θλυπις/thlupis, an unknown small bird mentioned by Aristotle.[5][6] Four subspecies are recognised:[6]"
174.Palm_Warbler,Palm Warbler,The palm warbler (Setophaga palmarum) is a small songbird of the New World warbler family.
175.Pine_Warbler,Pine Warbler,The pine warbler (Setophaga pinus) is a small songbird of the New World warbler family.
176.Prairie_Warbler,Prairie Warbler,The prairie warbler (Setophaga discolor) is a small songbird of the New World warbler family.
177.Prothonotary_Warbler,Prothonotary Warbler," The prothonotary warbler (Protonotaria citrea) is a small songbird of the New World warbler family. It is named for its plumage which resembles the yellow robes once worn by papal clerks (named prothonotaries) in the Roman Catholic Church. The prothonotary warbler is the only member of the genus Protonotaria and the only eastern warbler that nests in natural or artificial cavities. The prothonotary warbler was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1779 in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux from a specimen collected in Louisiana. Buffon coined the French name Le figuier protonotaire.[2] The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by François-Nicolas Martinet in the Planches Enluminées D'Histoire Naturelle, which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text.[3]  Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name Motacilla citrea in his catalogue of the Planches Enluminées.[4] The prothonotary warbler is now the only species placed in the genus Protonotaria that was introduced in 1858 by the American naturalist Spencer Baird.[5][6][7] The species is monotypic, no subspecies are recognised.[7] The genus name is from Late Latin protonotarius, meaning ""prothonotary"", a notary attached to the Byzantine court who wore golden-yellow robes. The specific citrea is from Latin citreus meaning the colour ""citrine"".[8] It was once known as the golden swamp warbler.[9] A molecular phylogenetic study of the family Parulidae published in 2010 found that the prothonotary warbler was a sister species to Swainson's warbler (Limnothlypis swainsonii).[10]"
178.Swainson_Warbler,Swainson's Warbler,"Swainson's warbler (Limnothlypis swainsonii) is a small species of New World warbler. It is monotypic, the only member of the genus Limnothlypis.  Swainson's warbler was named after William Swainson, an English ornithologist."
179.Tennessee_Warbler,Tennessee Warbler,"The Tennessee warbler (Leiothlypis peregrina) is a New World warbler that breeds in eastern North America and winters in southern Central America, the Caribbean, and northern South America. The specific name peregrina is from  Latin  peregrinus ""wanderer"".[2]"
180.Wilson_Warbler,Wilson's Warbler,"Wilson's warbler (Cardellina pusilla) is a small New World warbler. It is greenish above and yellow below, with rounded wings and a long, slim tail. The male has a black crown patch; depending on the subspecies, that mark is reduced or absent in the female. It breeds across Canada and south through the western United States, and winters from Mexico south through much of Central America. It is a very rare vagrant to western Europe. Wilson's warbler was formally described in 1811 by the ornithologist Alexander Wilson under the binomial name Muscicapa pusilla.[2] The type locality is southern New Jersey.[3] The species was moved to the genus Wilsonia by the naturalist and ornithologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1838. Zoologist Thomas Nuttall moved it to Sylvania in 1840, and by 1845, many authors included it in Myiodioctes. In 1899, the American Ornithological Union returned the species to Wilsonia.[4] The species is currently assigned to the genus Cardellina.[5] The genus name Cardellina is a diminutive of the Italian dialect Cardella, a name for the European goldfinch, and the specific epithet pusilla means ""very small"".[6] There are three recognized subspecies:[7] The chryseola subspecies, which nests in northern coastal California to southwestern coastal Canada, has a distinctive orange-tinged yellow forehead. The population of the subspecies has declined sharply in the 21st century because it migrates preferentially to the southern end of the Baja Peninsula in Mexico,[9] where luxury resort and residential developments have replaced the bird's habitat.[10]"
181.Worm_eating_Warbler,Worm eating Warbler,"The worm-eating warbler (Helmitheros vermivorum) is a small New World warbler that breeds in the Eastern United States and migrates to southern Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central America for the winter. The worm-eating warbler was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus's Systema Naturae. He placed it with the wagtails in the genus Motacilla and coined the binomial name Motacilla vermivora.[3] Gmelin based his account on the ""worm-eater"" that had been described and illustrated in 1760 by the English naturalist George Edwards in his Gleanings of Natural History. Edwards had received a specimen from the American naturalist William Bartram that had been collected in Pennsylvania.[4] The worm-eating warbler is now placed in the genus Helmitheros that was introduced in 1819 by the French polymath Constantine Samuel Rafinesque.[5][6] The genus name combines the Ancient Greek helmins meaning ""worm"", and -thēras meaning ""hunter"". The specific epithet vermivorum is from Latin vermis meaning ""worm"" and -vorus meaning ""-eating"".[7] The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.[6]"
182.Yellow_Warbler,Yellow Warbler,"The yellow warbler (Setophaga petechia) is a New World warbler species. Yellow warblers are the most widespread species in the diverse genus Setophaga, breeding in almost the whole of North America, the Caribbean, as well as northern South America. The genus name Setophaga is from Ancient Greek ses, ""moth"", and phagos, ""eating"", and the specific petechia is from Italian petecchia, a small red spot on the skin.[2]"
183.Northern_Waterthrush,Northern Waterthrush,"The northern waterthrush (Parkesia noveboracensis)[2] is a species of ground-feeding migratory New World warbler of the genus Parkesia. It breeds in the northern part of North America in Canada and the northern United States including Alaska, and winters in Central America, the West Indies and Florida, as well as in Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador.[3]  It is a rare vagrant to other South American countries and to western Europe. Its closest relative is the Louisiana waterthrush. The northern waterthrush was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus's Systema Naturae. He placed it with the wagtails in the genus Motacilla and coined the binomial name Motacilla noveboracensis.[4][5] Gmelin based his account on descriptions of the species by earlier authors, none of whom had coined a binomial name. In 1778 the French polymath the Comte de Buffon had described ""La fauvette tacheté de la Louisiane"" in his book Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux. A hand-coloured engraving by François-Nicolas Martinet was published separately to accompany Buffon's text.[6] The species was later described under the name ""New York warbler"" by the English ornithologist John Latham in 1783 and by the Welsh naturalist Thomas Pennant in 1785.[7][8] The northern waterthrush is now placed together with the Louisiana waterthrush in the genus Parkesia that was introduced in 2008 by George Sangster.[9] The genus name was chosen to honour the American ornithologist Kenneth Carroll Parkes.[10] The specific epithet noveboracensis is for New York, United States. It combines novus meaning ""new"" with Eboracum, the Latin name for York, England).[11] Latham had mentioned that the species was ""met with in the hedges about New York"".[7] The species is considered to be monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.[9]"
184.Louisiana_Waterthrush,Louisiana Waterthrush,"The Louisiana waterthrush (Parkesia motacilla) is a New World warbler, that breeds in eastern North America and winters in the West Indies and Central America. Plain brown above, it is white below, with black streaks and with buff flanks and undertail, distinguishing it from the closely related northern waterthrush. The habitats it prefers are streams and their surroundings, and other wet areas. The Louisiana waterthrush breeds in eastern North America from southernmost Canada and south through the eastern United States, excluding Florida and the coast. It is migratory, wintering in Central America and the West Indies. This is a rare vagrant to the western United States. They are one of the earlier neotropical migrants to return to their breeding grounds in the spring, often completing their migration in late March or early April, which is almost two months before most other warblers reach their breeding grounds. They are also one of the earliest warblers to vacate their breeding grounds, with some departing as early as July; almost all will have left by late August."
185.Bohemian_Waxwing,Bohemian Waxwing,"The Bohemian waxwing (Bombycilla garrulus) is a starling-sized passerine bird that breeds in the northern forests of the Palearctic and North America. It has mainly buff-grey plumage, black face markings and a pointed crest. Its wings are patterned with white and bright yellow, and some of the wing feathers have red tips, the resemblance of which to sealing wax gives these birds their common name. The two or three subspecies show only minor differences in appearance. Females are similar to males, although young birds are less well-marked and have few or no waxy wingtips. Although the Bohemian waxwing's range overlaps those of the cedar and Japanese waxwings, it is easily distinguished from them by size and plumage differences.

The breeding habitat is coniferous forests, usually near water. The pair build a lined cup-shaped nest in a tree or bush, often close to the trunk. The clutch of 3–7 eggs is incubated by the female alone for 13–14 days to hatching. The chicks are altricial and naked, and are fed by both parents, initially mostly with insects, but thereafter mainly fruit. They fledge about 14–16 days after leaving the egg. Many birds desert their nesting range in winter and migrate farther south. In some years, large numbers of Bohemian waxwings irrupt well beyond their normal winter range in search of the fruit that makes up most of their diet.

Waxwings can be very tame in winter, entering towns and gardens in search of food, rowan berries being a particular favourite. They can metabolise alcohol produced in fermenting fruit, but can still become intoxicated, sometimes fatally. Other hazards include predation by birds of prey, infestation by parasites, and collisions with cars or windows. The large numbers and very large breeding area mean that it is classified as being of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature."
186.Cedar_Waxwing,Cedar Waxwing," The cedar waxwing (Bombycilla cedrorum) is a member of the family Bombycillidae or waxwing family of passerine birds. It is a medium-sized bird that is mainly brown, gray, and yellow. Some of the wing feathers have red tips, the resemblance of which to sealing wax gives these birds their common name. It is a native of North and Central America, breeding in open wooded areas in southern Canada and wintering in the southern half of the United States, Central America, and the far northwest of South America. Its diet includes cedar cones, fruit, holly berries, and insects.[2] The cedar waxwing is listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List.[1] The genus name Bombycilla comes from the Ancient Greek bombux, ""silk"" and the Modern Latin cilla, ""tail"";[3] this is a direct translation of the German Seidenschwanz, ""silk-tail"", and refers to the silky-soft plumage of these birds.[4] The specific cedrorum is Latin for ""of the cedars"".[3]"
187.American_Three_toed_Woodpecker,American Three toed Woodpecker," The American three-toed woodpecker (Picoides dorsalis) is a medium-sized woodpecker (family Picidae), which is native to North America."
188.Pileated_Woodpecker,Pileated Woodpecker," The pileated woodpecker (/ˈpaɪlieɪtəd, ˈpɪl-/ PY-lee-ay-tid, PIL-ee-; Dryocopus pileatus) is a large, crow-sized woodpecker[3] with a prominent red crest, white neck stripe, and a mostly black body. These woodpeckers are native to North America, where it is the largest confirmed extant woodpecker species, and they are the third largest extant species of woodpecker in the world, after the great slaty woodpecker and the black woodpecker. It inhabits deciduous forests in eastern North America, the Great Lakes, the boreal forests of Canada, and parts of the Pacific Coast.The woodpecker is primarily an insectivore and eats insects that live in trees. Pileatids are famous for making large, nearly rectangular carvings into trees, which they either used to extract prey inside the tree or to make a nest. They are a species with a large range and an increasing population, causing them to be categorized as a species of ""least concern"" by the IUCN in 2016.[4] The English naturalist Mark Catesby described and illustrated the pileated woodpecker in his book The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands which was published between 1729 and 1732. Catesby used the English name ""The larger red-crested Wood-pecker"" and the Latin Picus niger maximus capite rubro.[5] When in 1758 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the tenth edition, he included the pileated woodpecker, coined the binomial name Picus pileatus and cited Catesby's book.[6] The specific epithet pileatus is a Latin word meaning ""-capped"".[7] The type locality is South Carolina.[8] The pileated woodpecker is now one of six species that the International Ornithological Committee and the Clements taxonomy place in genus Dryocopus. The North American Classification Committee of the American Ornithological Society concurs for the pileated and lineated woodpeckers, the only two of the six that occur in Central and North America.[9][10][11] However, BirdLife International's Handbook of the Birds of the World (HBW) places the pileated and several others in genus Hylatomus.[12] Genus Dryocopus was introduced by the German naturalist Friedrich Boie in 1826.[13][9] Two subspecies are recognized:[9]"
189.Red_bellied_Woodpecker,Red bellied Woodpecker,"The red-bellied woodpecker (Melanerpes carolinus) is a medium-sized woodpecker of the family Picidae. It breeds mainly in the eastern United States, ranging as far south as Florida and as far north as Canada. Though it has a vivid orange-red crown and nape it is not to be confused with the red-headed woodpecker, a separate species of woodpecker in the same genus with an entirely red head and neck that sports a solid black back and white belly.  The red-bellied earns its name from the pale reddish tint on its lower underside. The English naturalist Mark Catesby described and illustrated the red-bellied woodpecker in his book The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands which was published between 1729 and 1732. Catesby used the English name ""The Red-bellied Wood-pecker"" and the Latin Picus ventre rubro.[2] When in 1758 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the tenth edition, he included the red-bellied woodpecker, coined the binomial name Picus carolinus and cited Catesby's book.  Linnaeus specified the type locality as America septentrionali (North America).[3] The locality is now restricted to South Carolina.[4] The red-bellied woodpecker is one of 24 species now placed in the genus Melanerpes that was introduced by the English ornithologist William Swainson in 1832.[5][6] The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.[6]"
190.Red_cockaded_Woodpecker,Red cockaded Woodpecker,The red-cockaded woodpecker (Leuconotopicus borealis) is a woodpecker endemic to the southeastern United States.[5][6]  It is a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973.[7][8]
191.Red_headed_Woodpecker,Red headed Woodpecker,"The red-headed woodpecker (Melanerpes erythrocephalus) is a mid-sized woodpecker found in temperate North America. Its breeding habitat is open country across southern Canada and the east-central United States. It is rated as least concern on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)'s Red List of Endangered species, having been down-listed from near threatened in 2018.[2] The red-headed woodpecker should not be confused with the red-bellied woodpecker, which is similar in size but has a vibrant orange-red crown and nape; the red-bellied woodpecker is named for the pale reddish blush of its lower belly and has a distinctly patterned black and white back rather than the solid black one of the red-headed woodpecker. The English naturalist Mark Catesby described and illustrated the red-headed woodpecker in his book The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands, which was published between 1729 and 1732. Catesby used the English name ""The Red-headed Wood-pecker"" and the Latin Picus capite toto rubro.[3] In 1758, the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae to its tenth edition. He included the red-headed woodpecker and coined the binomial name Picus erythrocephalus, citing Catesby's book.[4] The specific epithet combines the Classical Greek ἐρυθρός, eruthros, meaning ""red"", and κεφαλή, kephalos meaning ""headed"".[5] The type locality is South Carolina.[6] The red-headed woodpecker is one of 24 species now placed in the genus Melanerpes, which was introduced by the English ornithologist William Swainson in 1832 specifically to accommodate the red-headed woodpecker.[7][8] The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognized.[8]"
192.Downy_Woodpecker,Downy Woodpecker," The downy woodpecker (Dryobates pubescens) is a species of woodpecker, the smallest in North America. Length ranges from 14 to 18 cm (5.5 to 7.1 in). Downy woodpeckers primarily live in forested areas throughout the United States and Canada, with the exception of deserts in the southwest and the northern tundra. The bird nests in tree cavities and feeds primarily on insects, although it supplements its diet with seeds and berries. The downy woodpecker is very similar in appearance to the hairy woodpecker, although they are not closely related. The downy woodpecker was described and illustrated with a hand-coloured plate by the English naturalist Mark Catesby in his The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands, which was published between 1729 and 1732.[2] When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition, he included the downy woodpecker, coined the binomial name Picus pubescens and cited Catesby's book.[3] The specific epithet pubescens is the Latin for ""pubescent"" or ""downy"".[4] Linnaeus specified the type locality as America septentrionali (North America) but the locality is now restricted to South Carolina.[5] The downy woodpecker was usually placed in either Dendrocopos or Picoides, but a molecular phylogenetic study published in 2015 found that these genera did not form monophyletic groups.[6] In the revised generic classification, the downy woodpecker was placed with four other species in the resurrected genus Dryobates, that had been erected in 1826 by the German naturalist Friedrich Boie with the downy woodpecker as the type species.[7][8] Within the genus, the downy woodpecker is sister to a clade containing Nuttall's woodpecker (Dryobates nuttalli) and the ladder-backed woodpecker (Dryobates scalaris).[9] Despite their close resemblance, the downy and hairy woodpeckers are not very closely related; the outward similarity is an example of convergent evolution. Why they evolved this way cannot be explained with confidence; it may be relevant that the species exploit rather different-sized foodstuffs and do not compete very much ecologically.[10][11] Seven subspecies are recognized:[8]"
193.Bewick_Wren,Bewick's Wren,"The Bewick's wren (Thryomanes bewickii) is a wren native to North America. It is the only species placed in the genus Thryomanes. At about 14 cm (5.5 in) long, it is grey-brown above, white below, with a long white eyebrow. While similar in appearance to the Carolina wren, it has a long tail that is tipped in white. The song is loud and melodious, much like the song of other wrens. It lives in thickets, brush piles and hedgerows, open woodlands and scrubby areas, often near streams. It eats insects and spiders, which it gleans from vegetation or finds on the ground.[2] Its historic range was from southern British Columbia, Nebraska, southern Ontario, and southwestern Pennsylvania, Maryland, south to Mexico, Arkansas and the northern Gulf States. However, it is now extremely rare east of the Mississippi River.[3] In 1827, the American ornithologist John James Audubon included an illustration of Bewick's wren under the binomial name Troglodytes bewickii in his The Birds of America.[4] In the companion Ornithological Biography, published four years later, Audubon explained that he had shot the specimen near St. Francisville, Louisiana in 1821 and had chosen the specific epithet bewickii in honour of his friend the engraver Thomas Bewick.[5] Bewick's wren is now the only species placed in the genus Thryomanes that was introduced by the English zoologist Philip Sclater in 1862.[6][7] The Socorro wren was formerly also placed in Thryomanes, but is now known to be a close relative of the house wren complex, as indicated by biogeography and mtDNA NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 sequence analysis, whereas Thryomanes seems not too distant from the Carolina wren.[8] Fifteen subspecies are recognised of which two are now extinct.[7] Subspecies can be distinguished by the small differences in the color of the dorsal feathers but this can be difficult for museum specimens as the colors tend to change after a few years of storage.[9]"
194.Cactus_Wren,Cactus Wren,"The cactus wren (Campylorhynchus brunneicapillus) is a species of wren that is endemic to the deserts of the southwestern United States and northern and central Mexico. It is the state bird of Arizona, and the largest wren in the United States. Its plumage is brown, with black and white spots as markings. It has a distinctive white eyebrow that sweeps to the nape of the neck. The chest is white, whereas the underparts are cinnamon-buff colored. Both sexes appear similar. The tail, as well as flight feathers, are barred in black and white. Their song is a loud raspy chirrup; akin in the description of some ornithologists to the sound of a car engine that will not start. It is well-adapted to its native desert environment, and the birds can meet their water needs from their diet which consists chiefly of insects, but also of some plant matter. The cactus wren is a poor flier and generally forages for food on the ground. Ornithologists generally recognize seven subspecies, with the exact taxonomy under dispute.

Its common name derives from their frequenting desert cactus plants such as the saguaro and cholla, building nests, roosting, and seeking protection from predators among them. Its bulky and globular nests are constructed of plant material and lined with feathers. They do not migrate; instead, they establish and defend the territories around their nests where they live all year-round. It lives in pairs, or as family groups from late spring through winter. Pairing among cactus wrens is monogamous; in each breeding season, the males chiefly build nests, the females incubate eggs, and both parents feed the young.

Populations have declined as the species faces threats related to human activities and habitat loss, although the species remains abundant. Habitat fragmentation and fire have been of particular concern, as the cactus wren is slow to disperse into new habitats. Introduced species have also hurt populations. Feral cats hunt many birds in urban settings, and invasive grasses take up valuable foraging space, reducing habitat size. Despite these threats, the cactus wren has proved adaptable. Cactus wrens have learned to coexist with humans effectively, using human materials and structures for nesting, and even learning to take insects from vehicle radiator grilles. The population still numbers in the millions, leading the International Union for Conservation of Nature to consider the cactus wren a species of least concern."
195.Carolina_Wren,Carolina Wren,"The Carolina wren (Thryothorus ludovicianus) is a common species of wren that is a resident in the Eastern United States, the extreme south of Ontario, Canada, and the extreme northeast of Mexico. Severe winters restrict the northern limits of their range, while favorable weather conditions lead to a northward extension of their breeding range. Their preferred habitat is in dense cover in forest, farm edges, and suburban areas. This wren is the state bird of South Carolina.

Seven recognized subspecies occur across the range of these wrens and they differ slightly in song and appearance. The birds are generally inconspicuous, avoiding the open for extended periods of time. When out in the open, they energetically investigate their surroundings and are rarely stationary. After finding a mate, pairs maintain a territory and stay together for several years. Both males and females give out alarm calls, but only males sing to advertise territory. Carolina wrens raise multiple broods during the summer breeding season, but can fall victim to brood parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds, among other species. Some populations have been affected by mercury contamination."
196.House_Wren,Northern House Wren," The northern house wren (Troglodytes aedon) is a very small passerine in the wren family Troglodytidae. It found in southern Canada, the USA and Mexico. It occurs in most suburban areas in its range. It formerly included many subspecies resident in South America and in the Caribbean that are now considered as separate species. The name troglodytes means ""hole dweller"", and is a reference to the bird's tendency to disappear into crevices when hunting insects or to seek shelter. The northern house wren was formally described in 1809 by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot under the current binomial name Troglodytes aedon.[2] The specific epithet is from the Ancient Greek aēdōn meaning ""nightingale"".[3] The type locality was designated as New York City by Harry Oberholser in 1934.[4][5] An earlier specific name, domestica in the combination Sylvia domestica, was introduced in 1808 by the American ornithologist Alexander Wilson.[6] This was rarely used and in 1998 to conserve the widely used name aedon, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature suppressed the specific name domestica for the purposes of the principle of priority.[7][8] Four subspecies are recognised:[9] The following species were formerly considered as subspecies in the house wren complex. The species were split based on the deep genomic divergence and differences in vocalizations and morphology.[9][10][11]"
197.Marsh_Wren,Marsh Wren,"The marsh wren (Cistothorus palustris) is a small North American songbird of the wren family. It is sometimes called the long-billed marsh wren to distinguish it from the sedge wren, also known as the short-billed marsh wren. The marsh wren was described by the Scottish-American ornithologist Alexander Wilson in 1810 and given the binomial name Certhia palustris.[2] The current genus Cistothorus was introduced by the German ornithologist Jean Cabanis in 1850.[3] There are 15 recognised subspecies.[4] Etymology: from Greek 'κιστος' (cistos, ""a shrub"") and 'θουρος' (thouros, ""leaping, or running through"") and Latin 'palustris' (""marshy"").[5]"
198.Rock_Wren,Rock Wren," The rock wren (Salpinctes obsoletus) is a small songbird of the wren family native to western North America, Mexico and Central America.  It is the only species in the genus Salpinctes."
199.Winter_Wren,Winter Wren,"The winter wren (Troglodytes hiemalis) is a very small North American bird and a member of the mainly New World wren family Troglodytidae. The species contained the congeneric Pacific wren (Troglodytes pacificus) of western North America and Eurasian wren (Troglodytes troglodytes) of Eurasia until they were split in 2010.[2] It breeds in coniferous forests from British Columbia to the Atlantic Ocean. It migrates through and winters across southeastern Canada, the eastern half the United States and (rarely) north-eastern Mexico. Small numbers may be casual in the western United States and Canada. The scientific name for its genus is taken from the Greek word troglodytes (from ""trogle"" a hole, and ""dyein"" to creep), meaning ""cave-dweller"", and may refer to their tendency to nest in cavities or their foraging behavior, in which the winter wren almost exclusively ground-gleans in thick underbrush.[3][4][5] The winter wren was described and illustrated in 1808 by the American ornithologist Alexander Wilson. He was uncertain as to whether the wren should be considered a separate species or a subspecies of the Eurasian wren.[6] When Louis Pierre Vieillot, a French ornithologist, described the winter wren in 1819 he considered it a separate species and coined the current binomial name Troglodytes hiemalis.[7] The specific epithet is Latin and means ""of winter"".[8] The type locality was restricted to Nova Scotia by Harry C. Oberholser  in 1902.[9][10] The winter wren was formerly considered to be conspecific with the Eurasian wren (Troglodytes troglodytes) and the Pacific wren (Troglodytes pacificus).[11][2] The Eurasian wren was split from the two North American species based on a study of mitochondrial DNA published in 2007.[12] A study published in 2008 of the songs and genetics of individuals in an overlap zone between Troglodytes hiemalis and Troglodytes pacificus found strong evidence of reproductive isolation between the two. It was suggested that the pacificus subspecies be promoted to the species level designation of Troglodytes pacificus with the common name of ""Pacific wren"".[13] By applying a molecular clock to the amount of mitochondrial DNA sequence divergence between the two, it was estimated that Troglodytes pacificus and Troglodytes troglodytes last shared a common ancestor approximately 4.3 million years ago, long before the glacial cycles of the Pleistocene, which are thought to have promoted speciation in many avian systems inhabiting the boreal forest of North America.[13][14] Two subspecies are recognised:[11]"
200.Common_Yellowthroat,Common Yellowthroat,"The common yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas), also known as the yellow bandit[2] or Maryland yellow-throat,[3] is a New World warbler. It is an abundant breeder in North America, ranging from southern Canada to central Mexico. The genus name Geothlypis is from Ancient Greek geo, ""ground"", and thlupis, an unidentified small bird; thlypis is often used in the scientific names of New World warblers. The specific  trichas is also from Greek; trikhas is a kind of thrush, the word being derived from trikhos, ""hair"".[4]"
